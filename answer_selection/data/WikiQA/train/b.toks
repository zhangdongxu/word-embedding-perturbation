viking 5c rocket engine
a rocket engine , or simply `` rocket '' , is a jet engine that uses only stored propellant mass for forming its high speed propulsive jet .
rocket engines are reaction engines and obtain thrust in accordance with newton 's third law .
since they need no external material to form their jet , rocket engines can be used for spacecraft propulsion as well as terrestrial uses , such as missiles .
most rocket engines are internal combustion engines , although non-combusting forms also exist .
rocket engines as a group have the highest exhaust velocities , are by far the lightest , but are the least propellant efficient of all types of jet engines .
cholera is an infection in the small intestine caused by the bacterium vibrio cholerae .
the main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting .
transmission occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces waste product of an infected person , including one with no apparent symptoms .
the severity of the diarrhea and vomiting can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance , and death in some cases .
the primary treatment is oral rehydration therapy , typically with oral rehydration solution , to replace water and electrolytes .
if this is not tolerated or does not provide improvement fast enough , intravenous fluids can also be used .
antibacterial drugs are beneficial in those with severe disease to shorten its duration and severity .
worldwide , it affects 3 ??? 5 million people and causes 100,000 ??? 130,000 deaths a year .
cholera was one of the earliest infections to be studied by epidemiological methods .

deepwater drilling is the process of oil and gas exploration and production in depths of more than 500 feet .
by this definition , there are approximately 600 deepwater wells in the gulf of mexico .
it has been economically infeasible for many years , but with rising oil prices , more companies are investing in this area .
major companies working in this sector include diamond offshore , transocean , and baker hughes .
there are basically two kinds of mobile deepwater drilling rigs : semi-submersible drilling rigs and drillships .
drilling can also be performed from a fixed-position installation such as a floating spar platform or tension-leg platform .
recent industry analysis has estimated that the total expenditure in the global deepwater infrastructure market will reach $ 145bn in 2011 .
??? not all oil is accessible on land or in shallow water .
you can find some oil deposits buried deep under the ocean floor . ??? ... using sonic equipment , oil companies determine the drilling sites most likely to produce oil .
then they use a mobile offshore drilling unit modu to dig the initial well .
some units are converted into production rigs , meaning they switch from drilling for oil to capturing oil once it 's found .
most of the time , the oil company will replace the modu with a more permanent oil production rig to capture oil . ??? ... the modu 's job is to drill down into the ocean 's floor to find
the part of the drill that extends below the deck and through the water is called the riser .
the riser allows for drilling fluids to move between the floor and the rig .
engineers lower a drill string -- a series of pipes designed to drill down to the oil deposit -- through the riser . ???
??? the expansion of deepwater drilling is happening despite accidents in offshore fields ... ???
in 2010 a large explosion occurred killing 11 workers and spilling millions of gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico while a bp oil rig was drilling in deep waters .
??? ... despite the risks , the deepwater drilling trend is spreading in the mediterranean and off the coast of east africa after a string of huge discoveries of natural gas . ???
??? the reason for the resumption of such drilling , analyst say , is continuing high demand for energy worldwide . ???
america needs the oil so it is almost necessary to face the high risks that come with deepwater drilling in order for americans to continue to carry on their everyday lives .
??? the energy department recently projected that gulf oil production would expand from its 2011 level of 1.3 million barrels a day , still nearly a quarter of total domestic production , to 2 million barrels a day by 2020
deepwater drilling affects the environment in both negative and positive ways .
although deepwater drilling rarely causes oil spills it is still a hazardous possible outcome .
oil spills result in oil sinking to the bottom of the ocean smothering plant life leaving fish without food and shelter to survive .
on the other hand deepwater drilling effects the environment in a positive ways too .
in time once the deepwater oil well is not in use anymore plants will grow on and around the well making a cave or cavern like shelter ideal for animals to thrive in .
deepwater drilling also lets us see the depths of the ocean floor that are hardly ever seen .

periodic table with electron shells
an electron shell may be thought of as an orbit followed by electrons around an atom 's nucleus .
the closest shell to the nucleus is called the `` 1 shell '' also called `` k shell '' , followed by the `` 2 shell '' or `` l shell '' , then the ``
the shell letters k , l , m , ... , used in the x-ray notation , are alphabetical .
each shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons : the 1st shell can hold up to two electrons , the 2nd shell can hold up to eight electrons , the 3rd shell can hold up to 18 ,
since electrons are electrically attracted to the nucleus , an atom 's electrons will generally occupy outer shells only if the more inner shells have already been completely filled by other electrons .
however , this is not a strict requirement : atoms may have two or even three incomplete outer shells .
-lrb- see madelung rule for more details .
for an explanation of why electrons exist in these shells see electron configuration .
the electrons in the outermost occupied shell or shells determine the chemical properties of the atom ; it is called the valence shell .
each shell consists of one or more subshells , and each subshell consists of one or more atomic orbitals .

upon the death , resignation , or removal from office of an incumbent president , the vice president assumes the office .
the president must be at least 35 years of age and a `` natural born '' citizen of the united states .
this list includes only those persons who were sworn into office as president following the ratification of the united states constitution , which took effect on march 4 , 1789 .
for american leaders before this ratification , see president of the continental congress .
the list does not include any acting presidents under the twenty-fifth amendment to the united states constitution .
there have been 43 people sworn into office , and 44 presidencies , as grover cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is counted chronologically as both the 22nd and 24th president .

george washington , the first president , was inaugurated in 1789 after a unanimous vote of the electoral college .
william henry harrison spent the shortest time in office with 32 days in 1841 , and franklin d. roosevelt spent the longest with over twelve years , but died shortly into his fourth term in 1945 .
he is the only president to serve more than two terms , and a constitutional amendment , affecting presidents after harry truman , was passed to limit the number of times an individual can be elected president .
andrew jackson , the seventh president , was the first to be elected by men of all classes in 1828 after most laws barring non-land-owners from voting were repealed .
warren harding was the first elected after women gained voting rights in 1920 .

the simplified internal structure of a chloroplast
overview of the calvin cycle and carbon fixation
the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis are chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and other compounds into glucose .
these reactions occur in the stroma , the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside of the thylakoid membranes .
these reactions take the light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them .
there are three phases to the light-independent reactions , collectively called the calvin cycle : carbon fixation , reduction reactions , and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate rubp regeneration .
despite its name , this process occurs only when light is available .
plants do not carry out the calvin cycle by night .
they , instead , release sucrose into the phloem from their starch reserves .
this process happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis c3 carbon fixation , c4 carbon fixation , and crassulacean acid metabolism ; cam plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night and release

confucianism , taoism , and buddhism are one , a painting in the litang style portraying three men laughing by a river stream , 12th century , song dynasty .
estimating the number of buddhists in the world , or in many countries , is difficult due to definitional issues as well as practical problems of enumeration .
to begin with , the religious beliefs , practices , and identities of east asians who comprise the majority of the world 's buddhists by any measure often blend buddhism with other traditions including confucianism , the chinese
most followers of buddhism do not belong to structured congregations , or observe a definite ritual of adherence such as taking refuge , making it difficult to accurately estimate the number of practitioners .
an additional challenge is the hostility of several national governments often communist ones such as china or north korea to religion generally or to buddhism specifically .
government policies in these countries may encourage the under-reporting or non-reporting of religious adherence , resulting in official totals that may drastically underestimate the number of religious practitioners in these countries .
estimate of the worldwide buddhist population range from 350 million to over one billion , but cluster nearer to the first figure .
adherents.com as of 2012 suggests a figure of 397 million .
by major branches , the numbers are as follows :
-lrb- 1 mahayana buddhism , including east asian buddhism , with no fewer than 185 million adherents , and possibly several times that many again , depending on definitional issues .
this is the predominant form of buddhism practiced in china , south korea , japan , taiwan , singapore , and vietnam .
-lrb- 2 theravada buddhism , with no fewer than 125 million adherents .
this is the predominant form of buddhism practiced in cambodia , thailand , laos , sri lanka , and burma .
-lrb- 3 vajrayana buddhism , with approximately 20 million adherents .
this form predominates in the greater tibetan and mongolian regions , as well as in the himalayas .
besides the independent countries of mongolia and bhutan , and various territories within what is now western china , vajrayana is traditional to certain regions of russia e.g. kalmykia , buryatia , india e.g. ladakh , sikkim
vajrayana , also known as tibetan buddhism , is often conflated with tantric buddhism , but this is imprecise , as shingon and other forms of east asian buddhism also practice tantra .
at least 7 countries sri lanka , thailand , cambodia , laos , burma , bhutan , and mongolia have unambiguous buddhist majorities .
depending on how one calculates chinese and other east asian adherents , this figure might expand to include several more countries .
in addition , buddhism is the state religion of cambodia and bhutan , and receives prominent mention in the constitutions of thailand and sri lanka .
in northern india and nepal , the land where buddhism was born , the religion severely declined during the first millennium .

external auditors may choose to place limited reliance on the work of internal auditors .
auditing promotes transparency and accuracy in the financial disclosures made by an organization , therefore would likely to reduce of such corporations to conceal unscrupulous dealings .
internationally , the international standards on auditing isa issued by the international auditing and assurance standards board iaasb is considered as the benchmark for audit process .
almost all jurisdictions require auditors to follow the isa or a local variation of the isa .

single malt scotch is single malt whisky made in scotland using a pot still distillation process at a single distillery , with malted barley as the only grain ingredient .
as with any scotch whisky , a single malt scotch must be distilled in scotland and matured in oak casks in scotland for at least three years most single malts are matured longer .
`` malt '' indicates that the whisky is distilled from a `` malted '' grain .
several types of grains can be malted for example , barley , rye and wheat are all grains which can be malted ; however , in the case of single malt scotch , barley is always the only

bottlings containing malt whisky from multiple distilleries are called '' blended malt '' .
until the scotch whisky regulations 2009 swr 2009 , the word `` blended '' only appeared in the context of scotch whisky on bottles of whisky that contained a mixture of both barley and non-barley grain
under the terminology established by the swr 2009 , a `` blended malt scotch whisky '' is a mixture of single malt scotch whiskies , not a mixture of malted barley whisky and non-barley whisky ; those are called ``
the term `` blended malt '' replaced `` vatted malt '' used under the prior labeling conventions .
the age statement on a bottle of single malt scotch is the number of years the whisky spent maturing in cask .
as very few whiskies are bottled from a single cask the age statement reflects the age of the youngest malt in the mix .

geologically , a continent extends to the edge of its continental shelf , so the now-separate islands are considered part of the continent .
due to the spread of animals , fungi and plants across the single pleistocene landmass the separate lands have a related biota .

a grab dredge
dredging is an excavation activity or operation usually carried out at least partly underwater , in shallow seas or fresh water areas with the purpose of gathering up bottom sediments and disposing of them at a different location .
this technique is often used to keep waterways navigable .
it is also used as a way to replenish sand on some public beaches , where sand has been lost because of coastal erosion .
dredging is also used as a technique for fishing for certain species of edible clams and crabs , see fishing dredge .
a dredger or ??? dredge ??? as is the general usage in the americas is any device , machine , or vessel that is used to excavate and remove material from the bottom of a body of water
for example , a scoop attached to the end of a rope or pole by which a man can draw sediments up from the bottom of a pond is a dredger .
developing this idea further , a motorized crane equipped with a drag bucket or clamshell grabber that is used to scoop material from the bottom of a body of water is also a dredger .
the crane could be located on the bank , or perhaps mounted on a barge .
if the crane is mounted on a barge , the entire vessel is referred to as a dredger .
the process of dredging creates spoils excess material , which are carried away from the dredged area .
dredging can produce materials for land reclamation or other purposes usually construction-related , and has also historically played a significant role in gold mining .
dredging can create disturbance in aquatic ecosystems , often with adverse impacts .
benedict arnold june 14 , 1801 was a general during the american revolutionary war who originally fought for the american continental army but defected to the british army .
while a general on the american side , he obtained command of the fort at west point , new york , and planned to surrender it to the british forces .
after the plan was exposed in september 1780 , he was commissioned into the british army as a brigadier general .
born in connecticut , arnold was a merchant operating ships on the atlantic ocean when the war broke out in 1775 .
after joining the growing army outside boston , he distinguished himself through acts of intelligence and bravery .
his actions included the capture of fort ticonderoga in 1775 , defensive and delaying tactics despite losing the battle of valcour island on lake champlain in 1776 , the battle of ridgefield , connecticut after which he was promoted
despite arnold 's successes , he was passed over for promotion by the continental congress while other officers claimed credit for some of his accomplishments .
adversaries in military and political circles brought charges of corruption or other malfeasance , but most often he was acquitted in formal inquiries .
congress investigated his accounts and found he was indebted to congress after spending much of his own money on the war effort .
frustrated and bitter , arnold decided to change sides in 1779 , and opened secret negotiations with the british .
in july 1780 , he was offered , continued to pursue and was awarded command of west point .
arnold 's scheme to surrender the fort to the british was exposed when american forces captured british major john andr ?? carrying papers that revealed the plot .
upon learning of andr ?? 's capture , arnold fled down the hudson river to the british sloop-of-war vulture , narrowly avoiding capture by the forces of george washington , who had been alerted to the plot .
arnold received a commission as a brigadier general in the british army , an annual pension of ?? 360 , and a lump sum of over ?? 6,000 .
he led british forces on raids in virginia , and against new london and groton , connecticut , before the war effectively ended with the american victory at yorktown .
in the winter of 1782 , arnold moved to london with his second wife , margaret `` peggy '' shippen arnold .
he was well received by king george iii and the tories but frowned upon by the whigs .
in 1787 , he returned to the merchant business with his sons richard and henry in saint john , new brunswick .
he returned to london to settle permanently in 1791 , where he died ten years later .
because of the way he changed sides , his name quickly became a in the united states for treason or betrayal .

in computer networking , a port is an application-specific or process-specific software construct serving as a communications endpoint in a computer 's host operating system .
a port is associated with an ip address of the host , as well as the type of protocol used for communication .
the purpose of ports is to uniquely identify different applications or processes running on a single computer and thereby enable them to share a single physical connection to a packet-switched network like the internet .
the protocols that primarily use ports are the transport layer protocols , such as the transmission control protocol tcp and the user datagram protocol udp of the internet protocol suite .
a port is identified for each address and protocol by a 16-bit number , commonly known as the port number .
the port number , added to a computer 's ip address , completes the destination address for a communications session .
that is , data packets are routed across the network to a specific destination ip address , and then , upon reaching the destination computer , are further routed to the specific process bound to the destination port number .
note that it is the combination of ip address and port number together that must be globally unique .
thus , different ip addresses or protocols may use the same port number for communication ; e.g. , on a given host or interface udp and tcp may use the same port number , or on a host with two
of the thousands of enumerated ports , about 250 well-known ports are reserved by convention to identify specific service types on a host .
in the client-server model of application architecture , ports are used to provide a multiplexing service on each server-side port number that network clients connect to for service initiation , after which communication can be reestablished on other connection-specific port

in england , wales , northern ireland and australia , arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial , and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment .
the defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each charge .
in federal courts of the united states , arraignment takes place in two stages .
the first is called the initial arraignment and must take place within 48 hours of an individual 's arrest , 72 hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before a judge until monday
during this arraignment the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel .
the presiding judge also decides at what amount , if any , to set bail .
during the second arraignment , a post-indictment arraignment or pia , the defendant is allowed to enter a plea .

health spending per capita , in $ us ppp-adjusted , with the us and canada compared amongst other first world nations .
comparison of the health care systems in canada and the united states are often made by government , public health and public policy analysts .
the two countries had similar health care systems before canada reformed its system in the 1960s and 1970s .
the united states spends much more money on health care than canada , on both a per-capita basis and as a percentage of gdp .
in 2006 , per-capita spending for health care in canada was us$ 3,678 ; in the u.s. , us$ 6,714 .
the u.s. spent 15.3 % of gdp on health care in that year ; canada spent 10.0 % .
in 2006 , 70 % of health care spending in canada was financed by government , versus 46 % in the united states .
total government spending per capita in the u.s. on health care was 23 % higher than canadian government spending , and u.s. government expenditure on health care was just under 83 % of total canadian spending public and private
studies have come to different conclusions about the result of this disparity in spending .
a 2007 review of all studies comparing health outcomes in canada and the us in a canadian peer-reviewed medical journal found that `` health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in canada versus the united states , but
life expectancy is longer in canada , and its infant mortality rate is lower than that of the u.s. , but there is debate about the underlying causes of these differences .

this study rated the us `` responsiveness '' , or quality of service for individuals receiving treatment , as 1st , compared with 7th for canada .
while the average life expectancy for canadians was 80.34 years compared with 78.6 years for residents of the us , simply comparing the life expectancy of two groups with different racial makeup and different obesity rates is likely not an

wine boy at a greek symposium
the history of wine spans thousands of years and is closely intertwined with the history of agriculture , cuisine , civilization and humanity itself .
archaeological evidence suggests that the earliest known wine production occurred in what is now the country of georgia around 7000 bce , with other notable sites in greater iran dated 4500 bce and armenia 4100 bce , respectively .
the world 's oldest known winery dated to 3000 bce was discovered in areni-1 cave in a mountainous area of armenia .

increasingly clear archaeological evidence indicates that domestication of the grapevine took place during the early bronze age in the near east , sumer and egypt from around the third millennium bce .
evidence of the earliest wine production in balkans has been uncovered at archaeological sites in northern greece macedonia , dated to 4500 bc .
these same sites also contain remnants of the world 's earliest evidence of crushed grapes .
in egypt , wine became a part of recorded history , playing an important role in ancient ceremonial life .
traces of wild wine dating from the second and first millennia bce have also been found in china .
moroccan wine kasher label 1930
the jewish tradition and use of kosher wine is dating back to biblical times .
the long history of the use and production of wine throughout ancient israel is backed up by archeological evidence .
within the jewish diaspora communities all around the globe , the traditional and religious use of kosher wine continued to this day .
wine , linked in myth to dionysus \/ bacchus , was common in ancient greece and rome , and many of today 's major wine-producing regions of western europe were established with phoenician and , later , roman plantations .
winemaking technology improved considerably during the time of the roman empire : many grape varieties and cultivation techniques were known ; the design of the wine press advanced ; and barrels were developed for storing and shipping wine .
rashi , a medieval french rabbi and called the `` father '' of all commentaries that followed on the talmud and the tanakh , earned his living as a vintner .
following the decline of rome and its industrial-scale wine production for export , the christian church in medieval europe also became a firm supporter of wine , necessary for celebration of the catholic mass. . whereas wine was forbidden in
geber and other muslim chemists pioneered the distillation of wine for islamic medicinal and industrial purposes such as perfume .
wine production gradually increased , with consumption burgeoning from the 15th century onwards .
wine production survived the devastating phylloxera louse of 1887 and eventually spread to numerous regions throughout the world .

earth is the third planet from the sun , and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the solar system .
it is also the largest of the solar system 's four terrestrial planets .
it is sometimes referred to as the world or the blue planet .
earth formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago , and life appeared on its surface within its first billion years .
earth 's biosphere then significantly altered the atmospheric and other basic physical conditions , which enabled the proliferation of organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer , which together with earth 's magnetic field blocked harmful solar
the physical properties of the earth , as well as its geological history and orbit , have allowed life to persist .
estimates on how much longer the planet will be able to continue to support life range from , to as long as .
earth 's lithosphere is divided into several rigid segments , or tectonic plates , that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years .
about 71 % of the surface is covered by salt water oceans , with the remainder consisting of continents and islands which together have many lakes and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere .
earth 's poles are mostly covered with ice that is the solid ice of the antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice that is the polar ice packs .
the planet 's interior remains active , with a solid iron inner core , a liquid outer core that generates the magnetic field , and a thick layer of relatively solid mantle .
earth gravitationally interacts with other objects in space , especially the sun and the moon .
during one orbit around the sun , the earth rotates about its own axis 366.26 times , creating 365.26 solar days , or one sidereal year .
the earth 's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 ?? away from the perpendicular of its orbital plane , producing seasonal variations on the planet 's surface with a period of one tropical year 365.24 solar days .
the moon is earth 's only natural satellite .
it began orbiting the earth about .
the moon 's gravitational interaction with earth stimulates ocean tides , stabilizes the axial tilt , and gradually slows the planet 's rotation .
the planet is home to millions of species of life , including humans .
both the mineral resources of the planet and the products of the biosphere contribute resources that are used to support a global human population .
these inhabitants are grouped into about 200 independent sovereign states , which interact through diplomacy , travel , trade , and military action .
human cultures have developed many views of the planet , including its personification as a planetary deity , its shape as flat , its position as the center of the universe , and in the modern gaia principle , as

cellular respiration is the set of the metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate atp , and then release waste products .
the reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions , which break large molecules into smaller ones , releasing energy in the process as weak so-called `` high-energy '' bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products .
respiration is one of the key ways a cell gains useful energy to fuel cellular activity .
cellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction .
the overall reaction is broken into many smaller ones when it occurs in the body , most of which are redox reactions themselves .
although technically , cellular respiration is a combustion reaction , it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell .
this difference is because it occurs in many separate steps .
while the overall reaction is a combustion reaction , no single reaction that comprises it is a combustion reaction .
nutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar , amino acids and fatty acids , and a common oxidizing agent electron acceptor is molecular oxygen o2 .
the energy stored in atp its third phosphate group is weakly bonded to the rest of the molecule and is cheaply broken allowing stronger bonds to form , thereby transferring energy for use by the cell can then
a stored-pressure fire extinguisher made by amerex
a british fire extinguisher with id sign , call point and fire action sign
a fire extinguisher , flame extinguisher , or simply an extinguisher , is an active fire protection device used to extinguish or control small fires , often in emergency situations .
it is not intended for use on an out-of-control fire , such as one which has reached the ceiling , endangers the user i.e. , no escape route , smoke , explosion hazard , etc. , or otherwise
typically , a fire extinguisher consists of a hand-held cylindrical pressure vessel containing an agent which can be discharged to extinguish a fire .
in the united states , fire extinguishers , in all buildings other than houses , are generally required to be serviced and inspected by a fire protection service company at least annually .
some jurisdictions require more frequent service for fire extinguishers .
the servicer places a tag on the extinguisher to indicate the type of service performed annual inspection , recharge , new fire extinguisher and when .
there are two main types of fire extinguishers : stored pressure and cartridge-operated .
in stored pressure units , the expellant is stored in the same chamber as the firefighting agent itself .
depending on the agent used , different propellants are used .
with dry chemical extinguishers , nitrogen is typically used ; water and foam extinguishers typically use air .
stored pressure fire extinguishers are the most common type .
cartridge-operated extinguishers contain the expellant gas in a separate cartridge that is punctured prior to discharge , exposing the propellant to the extinguishing agent .
this type is not as common , used primarily in areas such as industrial facilities , where they receive higher-than-average use .
they have the advantage of simple and prompt recharge , allowing an operator to discharge the extinguisher , recharge it , and return to the fire in a reasonable amount of time .
unlike stored pressure types , these extinguishers use compressed carbon dioxide instead of nitrogen , although nitrogen cartridges are used on low temperature -60 rated models .
cartridge operated extinguishers are available in dry chemical and dry powder types in the u.s. and in water , wetting agent , foam , dry chemical classes abc and b.c. , and dry powder class d
fire extinguishers are further divided into handheld and cart-mounted , also called wheeled extinguishers .
handheld extinguishers weigh from 0.5 to 14 kilograms 1 to 30 pounds , and are hence , easily portable by hand .
cart-mounted units typically weigh 23 + kilograms 50 + pounds .
these wheeled models are most commonly found at construction sites , airport runways , heliports , as well as docks and marinas .
central america is the central geographic region of the americas .
it is the southernmost , isthmian portion of the north american continent , which connects with south america on the southeast .
when considered part of the unified continental model , it is considered a subcontinent .
central america consists of seven countries : belize , costa rica , el salvador , guatemala , honduras , nicaragua , and panama .
central america is part of the mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot , which extends from northern guatemala through central panama .
it is bordered by mexico to the north , the caribbean sea to the east , the north pacific ocean to the west , and colombia to the south-east .
central america is an area of , or almost 0.1 % of the earth 's surface .
as of 2009 , its population was estimated at 41,739,000 .

a steam engine is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid .
using boiling water to produce mechanical motion goes back about 2,000 years , but early devices were not practical .
since the late 1700s steam engines have become a major source of mechanical power .
the first applications were removing water from mines .
in 1781 james watt patented a steam engine that produced continuous rotative motion .
these 10 hp engines enabled a wide range of manufacturing machinery to be powered .
the engines could be sited anywhere that water and coal or wood fuel could be obtained .
by 1883 , engines that could provide 10,000 hp had become feasible .
steam engines could also be applied to vehicles such as traction engines and the railway locomotives which are commonly just called steam engines outside america .
the stationary steam engine was a key component of the industrial revolution , allowing factories to locate where water power was unavailable .
today steam turbines generate about 90 % of the electric power in the united states using a variety of heat sources .
steam engines are external combustion engines , where the working fluid is separate from the combustion products .
non-combustion heat sources such as solar power , nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used .
the ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the rankine cycle .
in the cycle , water is heated into steam in a boiler until it reaches a high pressure .
when expanded through pistons or turbines , mechanical work is done .
the reduced-pressure steam is then condensed and pumped back into the boiler .
in general usage , the term steam engine can refer to either the integrated steam plants including boilers etc. such as railway steam locomotives and portable engines , or may refer to the piston or turbine machinery alone
specialized devices such as steam hammers and steam pile drivers are dependent on steam supplied from a separate boiler .

tacoma , is a mid-sized urban port city and the county seat of pierce county , washington , united states .
the city is on washington 's puget sound , southwest of seattle , northeast of the state capital , olympia , and northwest of mount rainier national park .
the population was 198,397 , according to the 2010 census .
tacoma is the second-largest city in the puget sound area and the third largest in the state .
tacoma also serves as the center of business activity for the south sound region , which has a population of around 1 million people .
tacoma adopted its name after the nearby mount rainier , originally called mount tahoma .
it is known as the `` city of destiny '' because the area was chosen to be the western terminus of the northern pacific railroad in the late 19th century .
the decision of the railroad was influenced by tacoma 's neighboring deep-water harbor , commencement bay .
by connecting the bay with the railroad tacoma 's motto became `` when rails meet sails . ''
today commencement bay serves the port of tacoma , a center of international trade on the pacific coast and washington state 's largest port .
like most central cities , tacoma suffered a prolonged decline in the mid-20th century as a result of suburbanization and divestment .
since the 1990s , developments in the downtown core include the university of washington tacoma ; tacoma link , the first modern electric light rail service in the state ; the state 's highest density of art and history museums
with a long history of blue-collar labor politics ??? from the railroad workers of the 19th century , to the longshoremen of the 20th century , to the labor ready workers of today ??? tacoma has long been known for
a song about tacoma , `` thrice all american '' , by american singer-songwriter and former resident neko case , describes it as `` a dusty old jewel in the south puget sound \/ where the factories churn \/ and
tacoma-pierce county has been named one of the most livable areas in the country .
tacoma was also recently listed as the 19th most walkable city in the country .
in contrast , the city is also ranked as the most stressed-out city in the country in a 2004 survey .
in 2006 , women 's magazine self named tacoma the `` most sexually healthy city '' in the united states .
in 2012 , the advocate gave tacoma the title of `` gayest city in america '' , in part because of the large diversity of public offices held , and washington state passing a bill in 2012 allowing lgbt couples
tacoma is famous for the 1940 collapse of the tacoma narrows bridge .

chula vista is so named because of its scenic location between the san diego bay and coastal mountain foothills .
founded in the early 19th century , fast population growth has recently been observed in the city .
as the second largest city in san diego county , chula vista has quickly become a destination popular to many tourists .
located in the city is one of america 's few year-round united states olympic training centers and popular tourist destinations include cricket wireless amphitheater , the chula vista marina , and the chula vista nature center .
sir isaac newton 25 december 164220 march 1727 was an english physicist and mathematician who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution .
his book philosophi ?? naturalis principia mathematica `` mathematical principles of natural philosophy '' , first published in 1687 , laid the foundations for most of classical mechanics .
newton also made seminal contributions to optics and shares credit with gottfried leibniz for the invention of the infinitesimal calculus .
newton 's principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that dominated scientists ' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries .
it also demonstrated that the motion of objects on the earth and that of celestial bodies could be described by the same principles .
by deriving kepler 's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity , newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the cosmos .
newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a theory of color based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the many colors of the visible spectrum .
he also formulated an empirical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound .
in addition to his work on the calculus , as a mathematician newton contributed to the study of power series , generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents , and developed newton 's method for approximating the roots of a
newton was a fellow of trinity college and the second lucasian professor of mathematics at the university of cambridge .
he was a devout but unorthodox christian and , unusually for a member of the cambridge faculty , he refused to take holy orders in the church of england , perhaps because he privately rejected the doctrine of trinitarianism .
in addition to his work on the mathematical sciences , newton also dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology , but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his
in his later life , newton became president of the royal society .
he also served the british government as warden and master of the royal mint .
prof. walter lewin explains newton 's law of gravitation in mit course 8.01
satellites and projectiles all obey newton 's law of gravitation
newton 's law of universal gravitation states that every point mass in the universe attracts every other point mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the
-lrb- separately it was shown that large spherically symmetrical masses attract and are attracted as if all their mass were concentrated at their centers .
this is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what newton called induction .
it is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in newton 's work philosophi ?? naturalis principia mathematica `` the principia '' , first published on 5 july 1687 .
-lrb- when newton 's book was presented in 1686 to the royal society , robert hooke made a claim that newton had obtained the inverse square law from him ??? see history section below .
in modern language , the law states the following :
assuming si units , f is measured in newtons n , m1 and m2 in kilograms kg , r in meters m , and the constant g is approximately equal to .
the value of the constant g was first accurately determined from the results of the cavendish experiment conducted by the british scientist henry cavendish in 1798 , although cavendish did not himself calculate a numerical value for g.
this experiment was also the first test of newton 's theory of gravitation between masses in the laboratory .
it took place 111 years after the publication of newton 's principia and 71 years after newton 's death , so none of newton 's calculations could use the value of g ; instead he could only calculate a force
newton 's law of gravitation resembles coulomb 's law of electrical forces , which is used to calculate the magnitude of electrical force between two charged bodies .
both are inverse-square laws , in which force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bodies .
coulomb 's law has the product of two charges in place of the product of the masses , and the electrostatic constant in place of the gravitational constant .
newton 's law has since been superseded by einstein 's theory of general relativity , but it continues to be used as an excellent approximation of the effects of gravity .
relativity is required only when there is a need for extreme precision , or when dealing with gravitation for extremely massive and dense objects .
white and red flags , representing iraqi and american deaths , sit in the grass quadrangle of the valley library on the corvallis , oregon , campus of oregon state university .
as part of the traveling iraq body count exhibit from 2008 to 2009 not related to iraq body count project , the flags aim to `` raise awareness of the human cost of the iraq war . ''
-lrb- may 2008
casualties of the conflict in iraq since 2003 beginning with the 2003 invasion of iraq , and continuing with the ensuing occupation of iraq , as well as the activities of the various armed groups operating in the country
the table below summarizes various estimates of the iraqi casualty figures .
for troops in the u.s.-led multinational coalition , the death toll is carefully tracked and updated daily , and the names and photographs of those killed in action as well as in accidents have been published widely .
a total of 4,486 u.s. soldiers were killed in iraq between 2003 and 2012 .
regarding the iraqis , however , information on both military and civilian casualties is both less precise and less consistent .
estimates of casualty levels are available from reporters on the scene , from officials of involved organizations , and from groups that summarize information on incidents reported in the news media .
the word '' casualties '' in its most general sense includes the injured as well as the dead .
accounts of the number of coalition wounded vary widely , partly because it is not obvious what should be counted : should only those injuries serious enough to put a soldier out of commission be included ?
do illnesses or injuries caused by accidents count , or should the focus be restricted to wounds caused by hostile engagement ?
sources using different definitions may arrive at very different numbers , and sometimes the precise definition is not clearly specified .
the national hockey league nhl ; is an `` unincorporated not-for-profit association '' which operates a major professional ice hockey league of 30 franchised member clubs , of which seven are currently located in canada and 23 in
headquartered in new york city , the nhl is widely considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world , and one of the major professional sports leagues in the united states and canada .
the stanley cup , the oldest professional sports trophy in north america , is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season .
the league was organized on november 26 , 1917 , in montreal , quebec , canada , after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization , the national hockey association nha , which had been founded in
it started with four teams and , through a series of expansions , contractions , and relocations , the league is now composed of 30 active franchises .
the nation to which the name of the league originally referred was canada , although the league has now been binational since 1924 when it expanded into the united states .
after a labor dispute that led to the cancellation of the entire 2004 ??? 05 season , the league resumed play under a new collective bargaining agreement that included a salary cap .
in 2009 , the nhl enjoyed record highs in terms of sponsorships , attendance , and television audiences .
the nhl draws many highly skilled players from all over the world and currently has players from about 20 different countries .
although canadians have historically constituted the majority of the players in the nhl , over the past four plus decades the percentages of us and european players have increased both because of the nhl 's continued expansion from six to

in parliamentary procedure , a motion to table has two different and contradictory meanings :
in the united states , to table usually means the to lay the topic on the table or to move for postponement of consideration ; a proposal to suspend consideration of a pending motion .
much less often , it means a motion to `` put on the table '' : a proposal to begin consideration or reconsideration , a usage consistent with the rest of the english-speaking world .
in the rest of the english-speaking world such as the united kingdom , to table means to move to place the topic upon the table or to move to place on the table : a proposal
both the american and the british dialects have the sense of `` to table '' as to lay the topic on the table or to cause the topic to lie on the table .
the difference is the idea of what the table is for , that of a shelf off to the side , or an active work bench .
the british meaning has the sense of the table as being an active work bench , with the topic being the center of attention , considered and discussed by all until it can be resolved , at which point it
the american sense is that the table is like that of a shelf , archive , or long-term storage device , where the topic has been disposed of by sending it to the ` table ' and leaving it there
secure digital or sd is a non-volatile memory card format for use in portable devices , such as mobile phones , digital cameras , gps navigation devices , and tablet computers .
the secure digital standard is maintained by the sd card association sda .
sd technologies have been implemented in more than 400 brands across dozens of product categories and more than 8,000 models .
the secure digital format includes four card families available in three different form factors .
the four families are the original standard-capacity sdsc , the high-capacity sdhc , the extended-capacity sdxc , and the sdio , which combines input\/output functions with data storage .
the three form factors are the original size , the `` mini '' size , and the `` micro '' size see illustration .
there are many combinations of form factors and device families .
electrically passive adapters allow the use of a smaller card in a host device built to hold a larger card .
host devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide backward compatibility and accept older sd cards , but this article explains several factors that can prevent the use of a newer sd card :
a newer card may offer greater capacity than the host device can handle .
a newer card may use a file system the host device can not navigate .
use of an sdio card requires the host device be designed for the input\/output functions the card provides .
the organization of the card was changed starting with the sdhc family .
some vendors produced sdsc cards above 1 gb before the sda had standardized a method of doing so .
the sda uses several trademarked logos to enforce compliance with its specifications and assure users of compatibility .
porcupines are rodents with a coat of sharp spines , or quills , that defend and camouflage them from predators .
they are indigenous to the americas , southern asia , and africa .
porcupines are the third largest of the rodents , behind the capybara and the beaver .
most porcupines are about long , with an long tail .
weighing , they are rounded , large and slow .
porcupines come in various shades of brown , gray , and the unusual white .
porcupines ' spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated erinaceomorph hedgehogs and monotreme echidnas .
the common porcupine is a herbivore .
it eats leaves , herbs , twigs and green plants like skunk cabbage and clover and in the winter it may eat bark .
the north american porcupine often climbs trees to find food .
the african porcupine is not a climber and forages on the ground .
it is mostly nocturnal , but will sometimes forage for food in the day .
porcupines have become a pest in kenya and are eaten as a delicacy .
the name porcupine comes from middle french porc espin spined pig .
a regional american name for the animal is quill pig .

effective nuclear charge diagram
the effective nuclear charge often symbolize as or z \* is the net positive charge experienced by an electron in a multi-electron atom .
the term `` effective '' is used because the shielding effect of negatively charged electrons prevents higher orbital electrons from experiencing the full nuclear charge by the repelling effect of inner-layer electrons .
the effective nuclear charge experienced by the outer shell electron is also called the core charge .
it is possible to determine the strength of the nuclear charge by looking at the oxidation number of the atom .

meister means master in german as in master craftsman , or as an honorific title such as meister eckhart .
the word is akin to maestro .
in sports , meister is used for the current national , european or world champion deutscher meister , \* europameister , weltmeister .
many modern day german police forces use the title meister .
during the second world war , meister was the highest enlisted rank of the ordnungspolizei .
meister has been borrowed into english slang , where it is used in compound nouns .
a person referred to as ??? meister ??? is one who has extensive theoretical knowledge and practical skills in his profession , business , or some other kind of work or activity .
for example , a ??? puzzle-meister ??? would be someone highly skilled at solving puzzles .
these neologisms sometimes have a sarcastic intent for example , ??? stubble-meister ??? for someone with a short , neat beard or ??? crier-meister ??? for someone who often cries .
edgar allan poe born edgar poe ; january 19 , 1809 ??? october 7 , 1849 was an american author , poet , editor and literary critic , considered part of the american romantic movement .
best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre , poe was one of the earliest american practitioners of the short story and is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre .
he is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction .
he was the first well-known american writer to try to earn a living through writing alone , resulting in a financially difficult life and career .
he was born as edgar poe in boston , massachusetts ; he was orphaned young when his mother died shortly after his father abandoned the family .
poe was taken in by john and frances allan , of richmond , virginia , but they never formally adopted him .
he attended the university of virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money .
after enlisting in the army and later failing as an officer 's cadet at west point , poe parted ways with the allans .
his publishing career began humbly , with an anonymous collection of poems , tamerlane and other poems 1827 , credited only to `` a bostonian '' .
poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals , becoming known for his own style of literary criticism .
his work forced him to move among several cities , including baltimore , philadelphia , and new york city .
in baltimore in 1835 , he married virginia clemm , his 13-year-old cousin .
in january 1845 poe published his poem , '' the raven '' , to instant success .
his wife died of tuberculosis two years after its publication .
he began planning to produce his own journal , the penn later renamed the stylus , though he died before it could be produced .
on october 7 , 1849 , at age 40 , poe died in baltimore ; the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol , brain congestion , cholera , drugs , heart disease ,
poe and his works influenced literature in the united states and around the world , as well as in specialized fields , such as cosmology and cryptography .
poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature , music , films , and television .
a number of his homes are dedicated museums today .
the mystery writers of america present an annual award known as the edgar award for distinguished work in the mystery genre .
heroes is an american science fiction television drama series created by tim kring that appeared on nbc for four seasons from september 25 , 2006 through february 8 , 2010 .

integrated bearer frame .
a backpack also called rucksack , knapsack , packsack , pack is , in its simplest form , a cloth sack carried on one 's back and secured with two straps that go over the shoulders , but
lightweight types of backpacks are sometimes worn on only one shoulder strap .
backpacks are often preferred to handbags for carrying heavy loads or carrying any sort of equipment , because of the limited capacity to carry heavy weights for long periods of time in the hands .
large backpacks , used to carry loads over 10 kg 22 lbs , usually offload the largest part up to about 90 % of their weight onto padded hip belts , leaving the shoulder straps mainly
this improves the potential to carry heavy loads , as the hips are stronger than the shoulders , and also increases agility and balance , since the load rides nearer the wearer 's own center of mass .
in ancient times , the backpack was used as a means to carry the hunter 's larger game and other types of prey and as a way of easier transport for other materials .
in the cases of larger hunts , the hunters would dismember their prey and distribute the pieces of the animal around , each one packing the meat into many wrappings and then into bags which they placed on to their
the bag itself was made up of different animal hide and skin depending on what sorts of animals were in the area and sewn together by the intestines of said animals , which were woven together tightly to

the `` betsy ross '' flag
a `` betsy ross '' flag flying outside san francisco city hall
the betsy ross flag is an early design of the flag of the united states , popularly attributed to betsy ross , using the common motifs of alternating red-and-white striped field with five-pointed stars in a blue canton .
the flag was designed during the american revolution and features 13 stars to represent the original 13 colonies .
the distinctive feature of the ross flag is the arrangement of the stars in a circle .
although the betsy ross story is accepted by most americans , some flag historians and revisionists do not accept the betsy ross design as the first american flag .
according to the traditional account , the original flag was made in june 1776 , when a small committee ??? including george washington , robert morris and relative george ross ??? visited betsy and discussed the need for a new
betsy accepted the job to manufacture the flag , altering the committee 's design by replacing the six-pointed stars with five-pointed stars .
while the betsy ross legend is questionable , the flag design is known to have been in use by 1777 ; alfred b. street described it at the surrender of general burgoyne and understood the circle of stars to represent
it is one of the oldest versions of u.s. flags known to exist ; while it is not the oldest surviving flag artifact in cloth form , its likeness appears on older physical relics , namely , the contemporary battlefield
they depict the circular star arrangement being flown from ship masts and many other places , and thus provide the first known historical documentation of the flag 's appearance .
the seal of the u.s. department of veterans affairs uses the betsy ross flag to represent service to all veterans from the american revolution to the present day .
the betsy ross design of 13-star us flags has been featured in many popular artworks sometimes inaccurately , as in washington crossing the delaware and films , such as the 1960 version of pollyanna .

personifications of germany , france , russia , austria-hungary , and the united kingdom attempting to keep the lid on the simmering cauldron of imperialist and nationalist tensions in the balkans to prevent a general european war .
they were successful in 1912 and 1913 but did not succeed in in 1914 .
the causes of world war i , which began in central europe in late july 1914 and finished in 1918 , included many factors , such as the conflicts and hostility of the four decades leading up to the war
militarism , alliances , imperialism , and nationalism played major roles in the conflict as well .
the immediate origins of the war , however , lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the crisis of 1914 , casus belli for which was the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand the archduke of austria
the crisis came after a long and difficult series of diplomatic clashes between the great powers italy , france , germany , the british empire , the austria-hungarian empire and russia over european and colonial issues in the
in turn these diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in europe since 1867 .
the more immediate cause for the war was tensions over territory in the balkans .
austria-hungary competed with serbia and russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the great powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties .
although the chain of events unleashed by the assassination triggered the war , the war 's origins go deeper , involving national politics , cultures , economics , and a complex web of alliances and counterbalances that had developed between
some of the most important long term or structural causes are : the growth of nationalism across europe , unresolved territorial disputes , an intricate system of alliances , the perceived breakdown of the balance of power in europe ,
other causes that came into play during the diplomatic crisis that preceded the war included misperceptions of intent e.g. , the german belief that the united kingdom would remain neutral and delays and misunderstandings in diplomatic communications .
the various categories of explanation for world war i correspond to different historians ' overall methods .
most historians and popular commentators include causes from more than one category of explanation to provide a rounded account of the causes of the war .
the deepest distinction among these accounts is between stories that see it as the inevitable and predictable outcome of certain factors , and those that describe it as an arbitrary and unfortunate mistake .
in attributing causes for the war , historians and academics had to deal with an unprecedented flood of memoirs and official documents , released as each country involved tried to avoid blame for starting the war .
early releases of information by governments , particularly those released for use by the `` commission on the responsibility of the authors of the war '' were shown to be incomplete and biased .
in addition some documents , especially diplomatic cables between russia and france , were found to have been doctored .
even in later decades however , when much more information had been released , historians from the same culture have been shown to come to differing conclusions on the causes of the war .
a contract is an agreement having a lawful object entered into voluntarily by two or more parties , each of whom intends to create one or more legal obligations between them .
the elements of a contract are `` offer '' and `` acceptance '' by `` competent persons '' having legal capacity who exchange `` consideration '' to create `` mutuality of obligation . ''
proof of some or all of these elements may be done in writing , though contracts may be made entirely orally or by conduct .
the remedy for breach of contract can be `` damages '' in the form of compensation of money or specific performance enforced through an injunction .
both of these remedies award the party at loss the `` benefit of the bargain '' or expectation damages , which are greater than mere reliance damages , as in promissory estoppel .
the parties may be natural persons or juristic persons .
a contract is a legally enforceable promise or undertaking that something will or will not occur .
the word promise can be used as a legal synonym for contract , although care is required as a promise may not have the full standing of a contract , as when it is an agreement without consideration .
contract law varies greatly from one jurisdiction to another , including differences in common law compared to civil law , the impact of received law , particularly from england in common law countries , and of law codified in regional
regarding australian contract law for example , there are 40 relevant acts which impact on the interpretation of contract at the commonwealth federal \/ national level , and an additional 26 acts at the level of the state
in addition there are 6 international instruments or conventions which are applicable for international dealings , such as the united nations convention on contracts for the international sale of goods .

lysergic acid diethylamide , abbreviated lsd or lsd-25 , also known as lysergide inn and colloquially as acid , is a semisynthetic psychedelic drug of the ergoline family , well known for its psychological effects which can include
it is used mainly as an entheogen , recreational drug , and as an agent in psychedelic therapy .
lsd is non-addictive , is not known to cause brain damage , and has extremely low toxicity relative to dose .
however , adverse psychiatric reactions such as anxiety , paranoia , and delusions are possible .
lsd was first synthesized by albert hofmann in 1938 from ergotamine , a chemical derived by arthur stoll from ergot , a grain fungus that typically grows on rye .
the short form `` lsd '' comes from its early code name lsd-25 , which is an abbreviation for the german `` lysergs ?? ure-diethylamid '' followed by a sequential number .
lsd is sensitive to oxygen , ultraviolet light , and chlorine , especially in solution , though its potency may last for years if it is stored away from light and moisture at low temperature .
in pure form it is a colorless , odorless , tasteless solid .
lsd is typically delivered orally , usually on a substrate such as absorbent blotter paper , a sugar cube , or gelatin .
in its liquid form , it can also be administered by intramuscular or intravenous injection .
lsd is very potent , with 20 ??? 30 ?? g micrograms being the threshold dose .
new experiments with lsd started in 2009 for the first time in 40 years .
introduced by sandoz laboratories , with trade-name delysid , as a drug with various psychiatric uses in 1947 , lsd quickly became a therapeutic agent that appeared to show great promise .
in the 1950s , officials at the u.s. central intelligence agency cia thought the drug might be applicable to mind control and chemical warfare ; the agency 's mkultra research program propagated the drug among young servicemen and
the subsequent recreational use of the drug by youth culture in the western world during the 1960s led to a political firestorm that resulted in its prohibition .
currently , a number of organizations ??? including the beckley foundation , maps , heffter research institute and the albert hofmann foundation ??? exist to fund , encourage and coordinate research into the medicinal and spiritual uses of lsd and

mens rea is latin for `` guilty mind '' .
in criminal law , it is viewed as one of the necessary elements of some crimes .
the standard common law test of criminal liability is usually expressed in the latin phrase , actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea , which means `` the act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty '' .
thus , in jurisdictions with due process , there must be an actus reus , or `` guilty act , '' accompanied by some level of mens rea to constitute the crime with which the defendant is charged see
as a general rule , criminal liability does not attach to a person who acted with the absence of mental fault .
the exception is strict liability crimes .
in civil law , it is usually not necessary to prove a subjective mental element to establish liability for breach of contract or tort , for example .
however , if a tort is intentionally committed or a contract is intentionally breached , such intent may increase the scope of liability as well as the measure of damages payable to the plaintiff .
therefore , mens rea refers to the mental element of the offence that accompanies the actus reus .
in some jurisdictions , the terms mens rea and actus reus have been replaced by alternative terminology .
in australia , for example , the elements of the federal offences are now designated as `` fault elements '' or `` mental elements '' mens rea and `` physical elements '' or `` external elements ''
this terminology was adopted to replace the obscurity of the latin terms with simple and accurate phrasing .

internationally , crosby has represented canada in numerous tournaments for the country 's junior and men 's teams .
after competing in the 2003 u-18 junior world cup , he represented canada in back-to-back iihf world u20 championships , winning silver in 2004 and gold in 2005 .
at the 2006 iihf world championship , he led the tournament in scoring , while also earning top forward and all-star team honors .
four years later , crosby was named to team canada for the 2010 winter olympics in vancouver .
playing the united states in the gold medal game , he scored the game-winning goal in overtime .
a united states cent , also known as a penny .
`` my two cents '' 2 ?? and its longer version `` put my two cents in '' is an united states us idiomatic expression , taken from the original english idiom expression : to put
it is used to preface the tentative stating of one ??? s opinion .
by deprecating the opinion to follow ??? suggesting its value is only two cents , a very small amount ??? the user of the phrase hopes to lessen the impact of a possibly statement , showing politeness and humility .
however , it is also sometimes used with irony when expressing a strongly felt opinion .
the phrase is also used out of habit to preface uncontentious opinions .
for example :
wealth in the united states is commonly measured in terms of net worth , which is the sum of all assets , including home equity , minus all liabilities .
the total net worth of us households and nonprofit organizations 1945 ??? 2009 , unadjusted for inflation or population change .
for example , a household in possession of an $ 800,000 house , $ 5,000 in mutual funds , $ 30,000 in cars , $ 20,000 worth of stock in their own company , and a $ 45,000 ira would
assuming that this household would have a $ 250,000 mortgage , $ 40,000 in car loans , and $ 10,000 in credit card debt , its debts would total $ 300,000 .
subtracting the debts from the worth of this household 's assets 900,000 - $ 300,000 = $ 600,000 , this household would have a net worth of $ 600,000 .
net worth can vary with fluctuations in value of the underlying assets .
the wealth ??? more specifically , the median net worth ??? of households in the united states is varied with relation to race , education , geographic location and gender .
as one would expect , households with greater income feature the highest net worths , though high income can not be taken as an always accurate indicator of net worth .
overall the number of wealthier households is on the rise , with baby boomers hitting the highs of their careers .
in addition , wealth is unevenly distributed , with the wealthiest 25 % of us households owning 87 % of the wealth in the united states , which was $ 54.2 trillion in 2009 .
including human capital such as skills , the united nations estimated the total wealth of the united states in 2008 to be $ 118 trillion .
hubble views of copernicus crater inset , which is about 58 miles 93 km wide
red and orange tinted moon , as seen from earth during a lunar eclipse , where the earth comes between the moon and sun
the moon is the only natural satellite of the earth , and the fifth largest satellite in the solar system .
it is the largest natural satellite of a planet in the solar system relative to the size of its primary , having 27 % the diameter and 60 % the density of earth , resulting in its mass .
the moon is the second densest satellite after io , a satellite of jupiter .
the moon is in synchronous rotation with earth , always showing the same face with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters .
it is the brightest object in the sky after the sun , although its surface is actually very dark , with a reflectance similar to that of coal .
its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have , since ancient times , made the moon an important cultural influence on language , calendars , art and mythology .
the moon 's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides and the minute lengthening of the day .
the moon 's current orbital distance , about thirty times the diameter of the earth , causes it to appear almost the same size in the sky as the sun , allowing it to cover the sun nearly precisely in
this matching of apparent visual size is a coincidence .
the moon 's linear distance from the earth is currently increasing at a rate of 3.82 ?? 0.07 cm per year , but this rate is not constant .
the moon is thought to have formed nearly 4.5 billion years ago , not long after the earth .
although there have been several hypotheses for its origin in the past , the current most widely accepted explanation is that the moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between earth and a mars - sized
the moon is the only celestial body other than earth on which humans have set foot .
the soviet union 's luna program was the first to reach the moon with unmanned spacecraft in 1959 ; the united states ' nasa apollo program achieved the only manned missions to date , beginning with the first manned lunar
these missions returned over 380 kg of lunar rocks , which have been used to develop a geological understanding of the moon 's origins , the formation of its internal structure , and its subsequent history .
after the apollo 17 mission in 1972 , the moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft , notably by the final soviet lunokhod rover .
since 2004 , japan , china , india , the united states , and the european space agency have each sent lunar orbiters .
these spacecraft have contributed to confirming the discovery of lunar water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles and bound into the lunar regolith .
future manned missions to the moon have been planned , including government as well as privately funded efforts .
the moon remains , under the outer space treaty , free to all nations to explore for peaceful purposes .
ronald wilson reagan ; february 6 , 1911 ??? june 5 , 2004 was the 40th president of the united states 1981 ??? 1989 .
prior to that , he was the 33rd governor of california 1967 ??? 1975 , and a radio , film and television actor .
born in tampico , illinois , and raised in dixon , reagan was educated at eureka college , earning a bachelor of arts degree in economics and sociology .
after graduating , reagan moved first to iowa to work as a radio broadcaster and then , in 1937 , to los angeles where he began a career as an actor , first in films and later television .
some of his most notable films include knute rockne , all american 1940 , kings row 1942 , and bedtime for bonzo 1951 .
reagan served as president of the screen actors guild and later as a spokesman for general electric ge ; his start in politics occurred during his work for ge .
originally a member of the democratic party , his positions began shifting rightward in the 1950s , and he switched to the republican party in 1962 .
after delivering a rousing speech in support of barry goldwater 's presidential candidacy in 1964 , he was persuaded to seek the california governorship , winning two years later and again in 1970 .
he was defeated in his run for the republican presidential nomination in 1968 and in 1976 , but won both the nomination and general election in 1980 , defeating incumbent jimmy carter .
as president , reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives .
his supply-side economic policies , dubbed '' reaganomics '' , advocated reducing tax rates to spur economic growth , controlling the money supply to reduce inflation , deregulation of the economy , and reducing government spending .
in his first term he survived an assassination attempt , took a hard line against labor unions , announced a new war on drugs , and ordered an invasion of grenada .
he was re-elected in a landslide in 1984 , proclaiming that it was '' morning in america '' .
his second term was primarily marked by foreign matters , such as the ending of the cold war , the 1986 bombing of libya , and the revelation of the iran-contra affair .
publicly describing the soviet union as an '' evil empire '' , he supported anti-communist movements worldwide and spent his first term forgoing the strategy of d ?? tente by ordering a massive military buildup in an arms race with
reagan negotiated with soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev , culminating in the inf treaty and the decrease of both countries ' nuclear arsenals .
reagan left office in 1989 .
in 1994 , the former president disclosed that he had been diagnosed with alzheimer 's disease earlier in the year ; he died ten years later at the age of 93 .
a conservative icon , he ranks highly in public opinion polls of u.s. presidents and is credited for generating an ideological renaissance on the american political right .
assassination attempts and plots on presidents of the united states have been numerous : more than 20 attempts to kill sitting and former presidents , as well as the presidents-elect , are known .
four sitting presidents have been killed : abraham lincoln the 16th president , james a. garfield the 20th president , william mckinley the 25th president and john f. kennedy the 35th president
two presidents were injured in attempted assassinations : former president theodore roosevelt the 26th president , and president ronald reagan the 40th president .
although the historian j.w. clarke has suggested that most american assassinations were politically motivated actions , carried out by rational men , not all such attacks have been undertaken for political reasons .
some attackers had questionable mental stability , and a few were judged legally insane .
since the vice president of the united states has for more than a century been elected from the same political party as the president , the assassination of the president is unlikely to result in major policy changes .
this may explain why political groups typically do not make such attacks .
oklahoma pawnee : uukuhu ?? wa , cayuga : gahnawiyo ?? geh is a state located in west south central united states .
oklahoma is the 20th most extensive and the 28th most populous of the 50 united states .
the state 's name is derived from the choctaw words okla and humma , meaning `` red people '' , and it is known informally by its nickname , the sooner state .

the american civil war acw , also known as the war between the states or simply the civil war see naming , was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the united states
the war had its origin in the issue of slavery , especially the extension of slavery into the western territories .
foreign powers did not intervene .
after four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the south 's infrastructure , the confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished , and the difficult reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing
in the 1860 presidential election , republicans , led by abraham lincoln , opposed expanding slavery into united states ' territories .
lincoln won , but before his inauguration on march 4 , 1861 , seven cotton-based slave states formed the confederacy .
outgoing democratic president james buchanan and the incoming republicans rejected secession as illegal .
lincoln 's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war .
eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession .
confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the confederacy .
a peace conference failed to find a compromise , and both sides prepared for war .
the confederates assumed that european countries were so dependent on '' king cotton '' that they would intervene ; none did and none recognized the new confederate states of america .
hostilities began on april 12 , 1861 , when confederate forces fired upon fort sumter , a key fort held by union troops in south carolina .
lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort ; consequently , four more slave states joined the confederacy , bringing their total to eleven .
the union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy .
the eastern theater was inconclusive in 1861 ??? 62 .
the autumn 1862 confederate campaign into maryland a union state ended with confederate retreat at the battle of antietam , dissuading british intervention .
lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal .
to the west , by summer 1862 the union destroyed the confederate river navy , then much of their western armies , and the union at vicksburg split the confederacy in two at the mississippi river .
in 1863 , robert e. lee 's confederate incursion north ended at the battle of gettysburg .
western successes led to ulysses s. grant command of all union armies in 1864 .
in the western theater , william t. sherman drove east to capture atlanta and marched to the sea , destroying confederate infrastructure along the way .
the union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the confederacy from all directions , and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the overland campaign towards richmond , the confederate capital .
the defending confederate army failed , leading to lee 's surrender to grant at appomattox court house on april 9 , 1865 .
the american civil war was one of the earliest true industrial wars .
railroads , the telegraph , steamships , and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively .
the mobilization of civilian factories , mines , shipyards , banks , transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed world war i .
it remains the deadliest war in american history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties .
historian john huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all northern males 20 ??? 45 years old , and 30 percent of all southern white males aged 18 ??? 40 .

nanotechnology sometimes shortened to `` nanotech '' is the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scale .
the earliest , widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products , also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology .
a more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the national nanotechnology initiative , which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers .
this definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale , and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal
it is therefore common to see the plural form `` nanotechnologies '' as well as `` nanoscale technologies '' to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size .
because of the variety of potential applications including industrial and military , governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research .
through its national nanotechnology initiative , the usa has invested 3.7 billion dollars .
the european union has invested 1.2 billion and japan 750 million dollars .
nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad , including fields of science as diverse as surface science , organic chemistry , molecular biology , semiconductor physics , microfabrication , etc. .
the associated research and applications are equally diverse , ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly , from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on
scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology .
nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications , such as in medicine , electronics , biomaterials and energy production .
on the other hand , nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology , including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials , and their potential effects on global economics , as well as speculation
these concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted .
health care in the united states is provided by many distinct organizations .
health care facilities are largely owned and operated by private sector businesses .
health insurance for public sector employees is primarily provided by the government .
60-65 % of healthcare provision and spending comes from programs such as medicare , medicaid , tricare , the children 's health insurance program , and the veterans health administration .
most of the population under 65 is insured by their or a family member 's employer , some buy health insurance on their own , and the remainder are uninsured .
of 17 high-income countries studied by the national institutes of health in 2013 , the united states was at or near the bottom in infant mortality , heart and lung disease , sexually transmitted infections , adolescent pregnancies , injuries
together , such issues place the u.s. at the bottom of the list for life expectancy .
on average , a u.s. male can be expected to live almost four fewer years than those in the top-ranked country .
according to the world health organization who , the united states spent more on health care per capita $ 7,146 , and more on health care as percentage of its gdp 15.2 % ,
the commonwealth fund ranked the united states last in the quality of health care among similar countries , and notes u.s. care costs the most .
the u.s. census bureau reported that 49.9 million residents , 16.3 % of the population , were uninsured in 2010 up from 49.0 million residents , 16.1 % of the population , in 2009 .
a 2004 institute of medicine iom report said : `` the united states is among the few industrialized nations in the world that does not guarantee access to health care for its population . ''
a 2004 oecd report said : `` with the exception of mexico , turkey , and the united states , all oecd countries had achieved universal or near-universal at least 98.4 % insured coverage of their populations by
a 2010 report observed that lack of health insurance causes roughly 48,000 unnecessary deaths every year in the united states .
in 2007 , 62.1 % of filers for bankruptcies claimed high medical expenses .
a 2013 study found that about 25 % of all senior citizens declare bankruptcy due to medical expenses , and 43 % are forced to mortgage or sell their primary residence .
on march 23 , 2010 , the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca became law , providing for major changes in health insurance .
a masonic lodge , often termed a private lodge or constituent lodge , is the basic organisational unit of freemasonry .
every new lodge must be warranted or chartered by a grand lodge , but is subject to its direction only in enforcing the published constitution of the jurisdiction .
by exception the three surviving lodges that formed the world 's first known grand lodge in london today called the united grand lodge of england have the unique privilege to operate as time immemorial i.e. without such warrant
a freemason is generally entitled to visit any lodge , in any jurisdiction i.e. under any grand lodge in amity with his own .
in some jurisdictions this privilege is restricted to master masons that is , freemasons who have attained the order 's third degree .
he is first usually required to check , and certify , the regularity of the relationship of the lodge - and be able to satisfy that lodge of his regularity of membership .
freemasons gather together as a lodge to work the three basic degrees of entered apprentice , fellowcraft and master mason .
black pepper piper nigrum is a flowering vine in the family piperaceae , cultivated for its fruit , which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning .
the fruit , known as a peppercorn when dried , is approximately in diameter , dark red when fully mature , and , like all drupes , contains a single seed .
peppercorns , and the ground pepper derived from them , may be described simply as pepper , or more precisely as black pepper cooked and dried unripe fruit , green pepper dried unripe fruit and white
black pepper is native to south india , and is extensively cultivated there and elsewhere in tropical regions .
currently vietnam is the world 's largest producer and exporter of pepper , producing 34 % of the world 's piper nigrum crop as of 2008 .
dried ground pepper has been used since antiquity for both its flavor and as a medicine .
black pepper is the world 's most traded spice .
it is one of the most common spices added to european cuisine and its descendants .
the spiciness of black pepper is due to the chemical piperine , not to be confused with the capsaicin that gives fleshy peppers theirs .
it is in the modern world , often paired with salt .
the president of the republic of south africa is the head of state and head of government under south africa 's constitution .
from 1961 to 1994 , the head of state was called the state president .
the president is elected by members of the national assembly , the lower house of parliament , and is usually the leader of the largest party , which has been the african national congress since the first non-racial elections were
the role was originally founded to be distinct from the now defunct role of prime minister , but the two roles were merged in the 1983 constitution which specified a four-year term of office .
the 1993 and later constitutions limits the president 's time in office to two five-year terms .
the first president to be elected under the new constitution was nelson mandela , and the incumbent president is jacob zuma .
under the interim constitution valid from 1994 to 1996 , there was a government of national unity , in which an mp from the largest opposition party was entitled to a position as deputy president .
along with thabo mbeki , the last state president , f.w. de klerk also served as deputy president , in his capacity as the leader of the national party which was the second-largest party in the new parliament .
but de klerk later resigned and went into opposition with his party .
a voluntary coalition government continues to exist under the new constitution adopted in 1996 , although there have been no appointments of opposition politicians to the post of deputy president .
an actor portraying alexander graham bell speaking into an early model telephone .
the invention of the telephone is the culmination of work done by many individuals , the history of which involves a collection of claims and counterclaims .
the development of the modern electrical telephone involved an array of lawsuits founded upon the patent claims of several individuals and numerous companies .
this article covers the early years from 1844 to 1898 , from conception of the idea of an electric voice-transmission device , to failed attempts to use `` make-and-break '' current , to successful experiments with electromagnetic telephones by alexander
the atomic bombings of the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki in japan were conducted by the united states during the final stages of world war ii in 1945 .
the two events are the only use of nuclear weapons in war to date .
following a firebombing campaign that destroyed many japanese cities , the allies prepared for a costly invasion of japan .
the war in europe ended when nazi germany signed its instrument of surrender on 8 may , but the pacific war continued .
together with the united kingdom and the republic of china , the united states called for a surrender of japan in the potsdam declaration on 26 july 1945 , threatening japan with `` prompt and utter destruction '' .
the japanese government ignored this ultimatum , and the united states deployed two nuclear weapons developed by the manhattan project .
american airmen dropped little boy on the city of hiroshima on 6 august 1945 , followed by fat man over nagasaki on 9 august .
within the first two to four months of the bombings , the acute effects killed 90,000 ??? 166,000 people in hiroshima and 60,000 ??? 80,000 in nagasaki , with roughly half of the deaths in each city occurring on the
the hiroshima prefecture health department estimated that , of the people who died on the day of the explosion , 60 % died from flash or flame burns , 30 % from falling debris and 10 % from other causes
during the following months , large numbers died from the effect of burns , radiation sickness , and other injuries , compounded by illness .
in a us estimate of the total immediate and short term cause of death , 15 ??? 20 % died from radiation sickness , 20 ??? 30 % from burns , and 50 ??? 60 % from other injuries ,
in both cities , most of the dead were civilians , although hiroshima had a sizeable garrison .
on 15 august , six days after the bombing of nagasaki , japan announced its surrender to the allies , signing the instrument of surrender on 2 september , officially ending world war ii .
the bombings led , in part , to post-war japan 's adopting three non-nuclear principles , forbidding the nation from nuclear armament .
the role of the bombings in japan 's surrender and their ethical justification are still debated .
mohandas karamchand gandhi ; 2 october 1869 ??? 30 january 1948 , commonly known as mahatma gandhi , was the preeminent leader of indian nationalism in british-ruled india .
employing non-violent civil disobedience , gandhi led india to independence and inspired movements for non-violence , civil rights and freedom across the world .
the son of a senior government official , gandhi was born and raised in a hindu bania community in coastal gujarat , and trained in law in london .
gandhi became famous by fighting for the civil rights of muslim and hindu indians in south africa , using new techniques of non-violent civil disobedience that he developed .
returning to india in 1915 , he set about organising peasants to protest excessive land-taxes .
a lifelong opponent of '' communalism '' i.e. basing politics on religion he reached out widely to all religious groups .
he became a leader of muslims protesting the declining status of the caliphate .
assuming leadership of the indian national congress in 1921 , gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty , expanding women 's rights , building religious and ethnic amity , ending untouchability , increasing economic self-reliance , and above all for
gandhi led indians in protesting the national salt tax with the dandi salt march in 1930 , and later in demanding the british to immediately quit india in 1942 , during world war ii .
he was imprisoned for that and for numerous other political offenses over the years .
gandhi sought to practice non-violence and truth in all situations , and advocated that others do the same .
he saw the villages as the core of the true india and promoted self-sufficiency ; he did not support the industrialization programs of his disciple jawaharlal nehru .
he lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community and wore the traditional indian dhoti and shawl , woven with yarn he had hand spun on a charkha .
his chief political enemy in britain was winston churchill , who ridiculed him as a `` half-naked fakir . ''
he was a dedicated vegetarian , and undertook long fasts as means of both self-purification and political mobilization .
in his last year , unhappy at the partition of india , gandhi worked to stop the carnage between muslims , hindus and sikhs that raged in the border area between india and pakistan .
he was assassinated on 30 january 1948 by nathuram godse who thought gandhi was too sympathetic to india 's muslims .
30 january is observed as martyrs ' day in india .
the honorific mahatma `` great soul '' was applied to him by 1914 .
in india he was also called bapu `` father '' .
he is known in india as the father of the nation ; his birthday , 2 october , is commemorated there as gandhi jayanti , a national holiday , and world-wide as the international day of non-violence .
gandhi 's philosophy was not theoretical but one of pragmatism , that is , practicing his principles in the moment .
asked to give a message to the people , he would respond , `` my life is my message . ''

the vietnam war was a cold war - era military conflict that occurred in vietnam , laos , and cambodia from 1 november 1955 to the fall of saigon on 30 april 1975 .
this war followed the first indochina war and was fought between north vietnam , supported by its communist allies , and the government of south vietnam , supported by the united states and other anti-communist countries .
the viet cong also known as the national liberation front , or nlf , a lightly armed south vietnamese communist common front directed by the north , largely fought a guerrilla war against anti-communist forces in the region
the vietnam people 's army north vietnamese army engaged in a more conventional war , at times committing large units into battle .
u.s. and south vietnamese forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations , involving ground forces , artillery , and airstrikes .
the u.s. government viewed involvement in the war as a way to prevent a communist takeover of south vietnam as part of their wider strategy of containment .
the north vietnamese government and viet cong were fighting to reunify vietnam under communist rule .
they viewed the conflict as a colonial war , fought initially against france , backed by the u.s. , and later against south vietnam , which it regarded as a u.s. puppet state .
american military advisors arrived in what was then french indochina beginning in 1950 .
u.s. involvement escalated in the early 1960s , with troop levels tripling in 1961 and tripling again in 1962 .
u.s. combat units were deployed beginning in 1965 .
operations spanned international borders , with laos and cambodia heavily bombed .
american involvement in the war peaked in 1968 , at the time of the tet offensive .
after this , u.s. ground forces were gradually withdrawn as part of a policy known as vietnamization .
despite the paris peace accords , signed by all parties in january 1973 , fighting continued .
u.s. military involvement ended on 15 august 1973 as a result of the case ??? church amendment passed by the u.s. congress .
the capture of saigon by the vietnam people 's army in april 1975 marked the end of the war , and north and south vietnam were reunified the following year .
the war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities see vietnam war casualties .
estimates of the number of vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 800,000 to 3.1 million .
some 200,000 ??? 300,000 cambodians , 20,000 ??? 200,000 laotians , and 58,220 u.s. service members also died in the conflict .

renal cell carcinoma rcc , also known as hypernephroma is a kidney cancer that originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule , the very small tubes in the kidney that transport gf glomerular filtrate
rcc is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults , responsible for approximately 80 % of cases .
it is also known to be the most lethal of all the genitourinary tumors .
initial treatment is most commonly a radical or partial nephrectomy and remains the mainstay of curative treatment .
where the tumor is confined to the renal parenchyma , the 5-year survival rate is 60-70 % , but this is lowered considerably where metastases have spread .
it is relatively resistant to radiation therapy and chemotherapy , although some cases respond to immunotherapy .
targeted cancer therapies such as sunitinib , temsirolimus , bevacizumab , interferon-alpha , and sorafenib have improved the outlook for rcc .

it uses an external power supply to make the dram non-volatile .
a solid-state drive ssd also known as a solid-state disk or electronic disk , though it contains no actual `` disk '' of any kind is a data storage device using integrated circuit assemblies as memory
ssd technology uses electronic interfaces compatible with traditional block input\/output i\/o hard disk drives .
ssds have no moving mechanical components , which distinguish them from traditional electromechanical magnetic disks such as hard disk drives hdds or floppy disks , which contain spinning disks and movable read\/write heads .
compared with electromechanical disks , ssds are typically less susceptible to physical shock , much quieter , have lower access time , and less latency .
however , while the price of ssds has continued to decline in 2012 , ssds are still about 7 to 8 times more expensive per unit of storage than hdds .
many ssds use i\/o interfaces developed for hard disk drives , thus permitting simple replacement in common applications .
, most ssds use nand-based flash memory , which retains data without power .
for applications requiring fast access , but not necessarily data persistence after power loss , ssds may be constructed from random-access memory ram .
such devices may employ separate power sources , such as batteries , to maintain data after power loss .
hybrid drives or solid state hybrid drives sshd combine the features of ssds and hdds in the same unit , containing a large hard disk drive and an ssd cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data .
these devices may offer near-ssd performance for many applications .
the roman empire was the post - republican period of the ancient roman civilization , characterised by an autocratic form of government and large territorial holdings around the mediterranean in europe , africa , and asia .
the 500-year-old roman republic , which preceded it , had been destabilized through a series of civil wars .
several events marked the transition from republic to empire , including julius caesar 's appointment as perpetual dictator 44 bc ; the battle of actium 31 bc ; and the granting of the honorific augustus to
the first two centuries of the empire were a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the pax romana `` roman peace '' .
it reached its greatest expanse during the reign of trajan 98 ??? 117 ad .
in the 3rd century , the empire underwent a crisis that threatened its existence , but was reunified and stabilized under the emperors aurelian and diocletian .
christians rose to power in the 4th century , during which time a system of dual rule was developed in the latin west and greek east .
after the collapse of central government in the west in the 5th century , the eastern half continued as what would later be known as the byzantine empire .
because of the empire 's vast extent and long endurance , the institutions and culture of rome had a profound and lasting influence on the development of language , religion , architecture , philosophy , law , and forms of
health spending per capita , in $ us ppp-adjusted , with the us and canada compared amongst other first world nations .
comparison of the health care systems in canada and the united states are often made by government , public health and public policy analysts .
the two countries had similar health care systems before canada reformed its system in the 1960s and 1970s .
the united states spends much more money on health care than canada , on both a per-capita basis and as a percentage of gdp .
in 2006 , per-capita spending for health care in canada was us$ 3,678 ; in the u.s. , us$ 6,714 .
the u.s. spent 15.3 % of gdp on health care in that year ; canada spent 10.0 % .
in 2006 , 70 % of health care spending in canada was financed by government , versus 46 % in the united states .
total government spending per capita in the u.s. on health care was 23 % higher than canadian government spending , and u.s. government expenditure on health care was just under 83 % of total canadian spending public and private
studies have come to different conclusions about the result of this disparity in spending .
a 2007 review of all studies comparing health outcomes in canada and the us in a canadian peer-reviewed medical journal found that `` health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in canada versus the united states , but
life expectancy is longer in canada , and its infant mortality rate is lower than that of the u.s. , but there is debate about the underlying causes of these differences .

this study rated the us `` responsiveness '' , or quality of service for individuals receiving treatment , as 1st , compared with 7th for canada .
while the average life expectancy for canadians was 80.34 years compared with 78.6 years for residents of the us , simply comparing the life expectancy of two groups with different racial makeup and different obesity rates is likely not an

although there is a measure of consensus that life-expectancy and infant mortality mark the most reliable ways to compare nation-wide health care , assuming the population makeup is similar , a recent report by the congressional research service carefully summarizes
the sound source has now broken through the sound speed barrier , and is traveling at 1.4 times the speed of sound , mach 1.4 .
since the source is moving faster with a speed than the sound waves it creates , it actually leads the advancing wavefront .
the sound source will pass by a stationary observer with a speed before the observer actually hears the sound it creates .
as a result , an observer in front of the source will detect
and an observer behind the source .

a sonic boom is the sound associated with the shock waves created by an object traveling through the air faster than the speed of sound .
sonic booms generate enormous amounts of sound energy , sounding much like an explosion .
the crack of a supersonic bullet passing overhead is an example of a sonic boom in miniature .
rfid chip next to a grain of rice .
this chip contains a radio-frequency electromagnetic field coil that modulates an external magnetic field to transfer a coded identification number when queried by a reader device .
this small type is incorporated in consumer products , and implanted in pets , for identification purposes .
radio-frequency identification rfid is the wireless non-contact use of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data , for the purposes of automatically identifying and tracking tags attached to objects .
the tags contain electronically stored information .
some tags are powered and read at short ranges a few meters via magnetic fields electromagnetic induction .
others use a local power source such as a battery , or else have no battery but collect energy from the interrogating em field , and then act as a passive transponder to emit microwaves or uhf radio waves
battery powered tags may operate at hundreds of meters .
unlike a bar code , the tag does not necessarily need to be within line of sight of the reader , and may be embedded in the tracked object .
rfid tags are used in many industries .
an rfid tag attached to an automobile during production can be used to track its progress through the assembly line .
pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses .
livestock and pets may have tags injected , allowing positive identification of the animal .
since rfid tags can be attached to clothing , possessions , or even implanted within people , the possibility of reading personally-linked information without consent has raised privacy concerns .

the kanab ambersnail , scientific name oxyloma haydeni kanabensis or oxyloma kanabense , is a critically endangered subspecies or species of small , air-breathing land snail , a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusc in the family succineidae , the amber snails
the common name of the amber snails is based on the shell , which is translucent and when empty usually resembles amber in color .
this species is endemic to the united states , specifically the state of arizona and utah , where it was first collected in the early 20th century .
it has been listed as endangered on the united states fish and wildlife service list of endangered species since 8 august 1991 .
this snail lives in wetlands , springs , and seeps , and only two of its natural habitats are known to exist : three lakes , a meadow near kanab , utah , and vasey 's paradise , a spring
in its natural habitat it is rather polyphagous , feeding mainly on bacteria , plants and fungi , and reproduces during the summer .
now considered a critically endangered species on the iucn red list of threatened species due to a series of factors including influence , the kanab ambersnail has been reintroduced to three springs above the historic high water level
the spanish language is the second most used language in the united states .
there are more spanish speakers in the united states than there are speakers of chinese , french , german , italian , hawaiian , and the native american languages combined .
according to the 2010 american community survey conducted by the u.s. census bureau , spanish is the primary language spoken at home by almost 37 million people aged five or older , a figure more than double that of 1990
there are 45 million hispanophones who speak spanish as a first or second language , as well as six million spanish language students , composing the largest national spanish-speaking community outside of mexico and making spanish the romance language and
roughly half of all u.s. spanish speakers also speak english `` very well , '' based on the self-assessment census question respondents .
the language came to the country since the 16th and 17th centuries with the arrival of spanish colonists in areas that would later become the states of florida , texas , colorado , new mexico , arizona , nevada ,
also west of louisiana territory was spanish between 1763 - 1800 year of the french recovery of territory , after the french and indian war .
after of the incorporation of these states to the u.s. in first half of 19th century , the spanish language was later reinforced by the acquisition of puerto rico in 1898 and by later waves of the hispanic emigration ,

sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the deposition of material at the earth 's surface and within bodies of water .
sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause mineral and\/or organic particles detritus to settle and accumulate or minerals to precipitate from a solution .
particles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment .
before being deposited , sediment was formed by weathering and erosion in a source area , and then transported to the place of deposition by water , wind , ice , mass movement or glaciers which are called agents of
the sedimentary rock cover of the continents of the earth 's crust is extensive , but the total contribution of sedimentary rocks is estimated to be only 8 % of the total volume of the crust .
sedimentary rocks are only a thin veneer over a crust consisting mainly of igneous and metamorphic rocks .
sedimentary rocks are deposited in layers as strata , forming a structure called bedding .
the study of sedimentary rocks and rock strata provides information about the subsurface that is useful for civil engineering , for example in the construction of roads , houses , tunnels , canals or other constructions .
sedimentary rocks are also important sources of natural resources like coal , fossil fuels , drinking water or ores .
the study of the sequence of sedimentary rock strata is the main source for scientific knowledge about the earth 's history , including palaeogeography , paleoclimatology and the history of life .
the scientific discipline that studies the properties and origin of sedimentary rocks is called sedimentology .
sedimentology is both part of geology and physical geography and overlaps partly with other disciplines in the earth sciences , such as pedology , geomorphology , geochemistry or structural geology .

saint patrick ; ; modern ; ; c. 387 ??? 17 march c. 460 or c. 492 was a romano-british christian missionary and bishop in ireland .
known as the `` apostle of ireland '' , he is the primary patron saint of the island along with saints brigid and columba .
two authentic letters from him survive , from which come the only generally accepted details of his life .
when he was about 16 , he was captured from his home and taken as a slave to ireland , where he lived for six years before escaping and returning to his family .
after becoming a cleric , he returned to northern and western ireland as an ordained bishop , but little is known about the places where he worked .
by the seventh century , he had already come to be revered as the patron saint of ireland .
most available details of his life are from subsequent hagiographies , and these are now not accepted without detailed criticism .
the annals of ulster state that he arrived in ireland in 432 , ministered in ulster around 443 , and died in 457 or 461 .
the text , however , distinguishes between `` old patrick '' thought to mean palladius and `` patrick , archapostle of the scots , '' who died in 492 .
the actual dates of patrick 's life can not be fixed with certainty but , on a widespread interpretation , he was active as a missionary in ireland during the second half of the 5th century .
he is generally credited with being the first bishop of armagh , primate of all ireland .
saint patrick 's day is observed on march 17 , the date of his death .
it is celebrated both inside and outside ireland , as both a religious and , especially outside ireland , secular holiday .
in the dioceses of ireland , it is both a solemnity and a holy day of obligation ; outside ireland , it can be a celebration of ireland itself .
line segments in the golden ratio
a golden rectangle with longer side a and shorter side b , when placed adjacent to a square with sides of length a , will produce a similar golden rectangle with longer side a + b and shorter side a.
this illustrates the relationship .
in mathematics and the arts , two quantities are in the golden ratio if the ratio of the sum of the quantities to the larger quantity is equal to the ratio of the larger quantity to the smaller one .
the figure on the right illustrates the geometric relationship .
expressed algebraically :
where the greek letter phi represents the golden ratio .
its value is :
the golden ratio is also called the golden section latin : sectio aurea or golden mean .
other names include extreme and mean ratio , medial section , divine proportion , divine section latin : sectio divina , golden proportion , golden cut , and golden number .
many 20th century artists and architects have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio ??? especially in the form of the golden rectangle , in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio
mathematicians since euclid have studied the properties of the golden ratio , including its appearance in the dimensions of a regular pentagon and in a golden rectangle , which can be cut into a square and a smaller rectangle with
the golden ratio has also been used to analyze the proportions of natural objects as well as man-made systems such as financial markets , in some cases based on dubious fits to data .

a computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a finite set of arithmetic or logical operations .
since a sequence of operations can be readily changed , the computer can solve more than one kind of problem .
conventionally , a computer consists of at least one processing element , typically a central processing unit cpu and some form of memory .
the processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations , and a sequencing and control unit that can change the order of operations based on stored information .
peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source , and the result of operations saved and retrieved .
the first electronic digital computers were developed between 1940 and 1945 in the united kingdom and united states .
originally they were the size of a large room , consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers pcs .
in this era mechanical analog computers were used for military applications .
modern computers based on integrated circuits are millions to billions of times more capable than the early machines , and occupy a fraction of the space .
simple computers are small enough to fit into mobile devices , and mobile computers can be powered by small batteries .
personal computers in their various forms are icons of the information age and are what most people think of as ??? computers . ???
however , the embedded computers found in many devices from mp3 players to fighter aircraft and from toys to industrial robots are the most numerous .
`` barefoot and pregnant '' is a phrase most commonly associated with the controversial idea that women should not work outside the home and should have many children during their reproductive years .
it has several other meanings as well .
it is a figure of speech .
the phrase `` barefoot and pregnant '' was probably first used sometime before 1950 .
an article from 1949 states , `` by early 1949 , twa was ??? in the words of its new president , ralph s. damon ??? both ` barefoot and pregnant . ' ''
its usage may date as early as the 1910s .
an article published in 1958 states the phrase was first used by a `` dr. hertzler '' 40 years earlier .
`` some forty years ago , dr. hertzler advanced a hypothesis which young women of today seem bent on proving correct . '
the only way to keep a woman happy , ' he said , ` is to keep her barefoot and pregnant . ' ''

adenosine deaminase deficiency , also called ada deficiency or ada-scid , is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that causes immunodeficiency .
it occurs in fewer than one in 100,000 live births worldwide .
it accounts for about 15 % of all cases of severe combined immunodeficiency scid .
it is very rare , you have a 3 % chance of getting this gene .
ada deficiency may be present in infancy , childhood , adolescense , or adulthood .
age of onset and severity is related to some 29 known genotypes associated with the disorder .
human height is the distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head in a human body , standing erect .
when populations share genetic background and environmental factors , average height is frequently characteristic within the group .
exceptional height variation around 20 % deviation from average within such a population is sometimes due to gigantism or dwarfism , which are medical conditions caused by specific genes or endocrine abnormalities .
in regions of extreme poverty or prolonged warfare , environmental factors like chronic malnutrition during childhood or adolescence may account for delayed growth and\/or in severe cases marked reductions in adult stature even without the presence of any

the legality of cannabis varies from country to country .
possession of cannabis is illegal in most countries and has been since the beginning of widespread cannabis prohibition in the late 1930s .
however , many countries have decriminalized the possession of small quantities of cannabis , particularly in north america , south america and europe .
furthermore , possession is legal or effectively legal in the netherlands , north korea and would be in the u.s. states of colorado and washington if it were not for federal law , which governs persons in all states .
the medicinal use of cannabis is legal in a number of countries , including canada , the czech republic and israel .
while federal law in the united states bans all sale and possession of cannabis , enforcement varies widely at the state level and some states have established medicinal marijuana programs in that contradict federal law ; two states colorado
some countries have laws that are not as vigorously prosecuted as others but , apart from the countries that offer access to medical marijuana , most countries have various penalties ranging from lenient to very severe .
some infractions are taken more seriously in some countries than others in regard to the cultivation , use , possession or transfer of cannabis for recreational use .
a few jurisdictions have lessened penalties for possession of small quantities of cannabis , making it punishable by confiscation and a fine , rather than imprisonment .
some jurisdictions \/ drug courts use mandatory treatment programs for young or frequent users , with freedom from narcotic drugs as the goal and a few jurisdictions permit cannabis use for medicinal purposes .
there are also changes in a more restrictive direction as in canada .
drug tests to detect cannabis are increasingly common in many countries and have resulted in jail sentences and people losing their jobs .
however , simple possession can carry long jail sentences in some countries , particularly in parts of east asia and southeast asia where the sale of cannabis may lead to a sentence of life in prison or even execution .

the mucous membranes or mucosae or mucosas ; singular mucosa are linings of mostly endodermal origin , covered in epithelium , which are involved in absorption and secretion .
they line cavities that are exposed to the external environment and internal organs .
they are at several places contiguous with skin : at the nostrils , the lips of the mouth , the eyelids , the ears , the genital area , and the anus .
the sticky , thick fluid secreted by the mucous membranes and glands is termed mucus .
the term mucous membrane refers to where they are found in the body and not every mucous membrane secretes mucus .
the glans clitoridis , glans penis head of the penis , along with the inside of the foreskin and the clitoral hood , are mucous membranes .
the urethra is also a mucous membrane .

public policy is the principled guide to action taken by the administrative executive branches of the state with regard to a class of issues in a manner consistent with law and institutional customs .
in general , the foundation is the pertinent national and substantial constitutional law and implementing legislation such as the us federal code .
further substrates include both judicial interpretations and regulations which are generally authorized by legislation .
other scholars define it as a system of `` courses of action , regulatory measures , laws , and funding priorities concerning a given topic promulgated by a governmental entity or its representatives . ''
public policy is commonly embodied `` in constitutions , legislative acts , and judicial decisions . ''
in the united states , this concept refers not only to the result of policies , but more broadly to the decision-making and analysis of governmental decisions .
as an academic discipline , public policy is studied by professors and students at public policy schools of major universities throughout the country .

henry was the second monarch of the tudor dynasty , succeeding his father , henry vii .
besides his six marriages , henry viii is known for his role in the separation of the church of england from the roman catholic church .
henry 's struggles with rome led to the separation of the church of england from papal authority , the dissolution of the monasteries , and his own establishment as the supreme head of the church of england .
yet he remained a believer in core catholic theological teachings , even after his excommunication from the roman catholic church .
henry oversaw the legal union of england and wales with the laws in wales acts 1535 and 1542 .
in 1513 , the new king allied with the holy roman emperor , maximillian i , and invaded france in 1513 with a large , well-equipped army , but achieved little at a considerable financial cost .
maximillian , for his part , used the english invasion to his own ends , and this prejudiced england 's ability to defeat the french .
this foray would prove the start of an obsession for henry , who invaded again in 1544 .
this time , henry 's forces captured the important city of boulogne , but again the holy roman emperor , charles v , supported henry only as long as he needed to and england , strained by the enormous cost
his contemporaries considered henry in his prime to be an attractive , educated and accomplished king , and he has been described as `` one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the english throne '' .
besides ruling with absolute power , he also engaged himself as an author and composer .
his desire to provide england with a male heir ??? which stemmed partly from personal vanity and partly because he believed a daughter would be unable to consolidate the tudor dynasty and the fragile peace that existed following the wars
henry became morbidly obese and his health suffered , contributing to his death in 1547 .
he is frequently characterised in his later life as a lustful , egotistical , harsh , and insecure king .

different religious groups include different books in their biblical canons , in varying orders , and sometimes divide or combine books , or incorporate additional material into canonical books .
christian bibles range from the sixty-six books of the protestant canon to the eighty-one books of the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church canon .
the hebrew bible , or tanakh , contains twenty-four books divided into three parts ; the five books of the torah `` teaching '' or `` law '' , the nevi'im `` prophets '' , and
the first part of christian bibles is the old testament , which contains , at minimum , the twenty-four books of the hebrew bible divided into thirty-nine books and ordered differently from the hebrew bible .
the catholic church and eastern christian churches also hold certain deuterocanonical books and passages to be part of the old testament canon .
the second part is the new testament , containing twenty-seven books ; the four canonical gospels , acts of the apostles , twenty-one epistles or letters and the book of revelation .
the eastern orthodox , oriental orthodox and eastern catholic churches may have minor differences in their lists of accepted books .
the list given here for these churches is the most inclusive : if at least one eastern church accepts the book it is included here .

a stalagmite or ; from the greek ?????????????????????? - stalagmit ?? s , from ???????????????????? - stalagmias , `` dropping , trickling '' is a type of speleothem that rises from the floor of a limestone cave due
this stalagmite formation occurs only under certain ph conditions within the underground cavern .
the corresponding formation on the ceiling of a cave is known as a stalactite .
if these formations grow together , the result is known as a column .
the hall of giants in the carlsbad caverns
stalagmites should normally not be touched , since the rock buildup is formed by minerals precipitating out of the water solution onto the old surface ; skin oils can alter the surface where the mineral water will cling , thus
oils and dirt from human contact can also stain the formation and change its color permanently .
similar structures can also form in lava tubes , associated with some types of lavacicles , although the mechanism of formation is very different .
stalactites and stalagmites can also form on concrete ceilings and floors , although they form much more rapidly there than in the natural cave environment .
the largest stalagmite in the world is high and is located in the cave of cueva martin infierno , cuba .

a scanner with duplexing automatic document feeder .
in multifunction or all-in-one printers , fax machines , photocopiers and scanners , an automatic document feeder or adf is a feature which takes several pages and feeds the paper one page at a time into a scanner or copier
most copiers allow scanning on the flatbed or platen the `` glass '' or through a document feeder .
the vast majority of fax machines have an adf , allowing the unattended sending of multi-page faxes .
due to the ubiquity of adf in fax machines , some fax machine owners use the fax machine as a scanner , faxing multi-page documents to themselves .
document feeders are described by speed , in pages per minute or ppm , and capacity , usually in a range from 10 sheets to 200 .
there are two kinds of document feeders capable of two-sided duplex scanning : a reversing automatic document feeder or radf scans one side of a page , then flips it and scans the other side .
a duplexing automatic document feeder or dadf scans both sides in one pass .
the advantage of the dadf is faster speed for two-sided originals .
radfs and dadfs are rated in images per minute ipm , the number of sides they can scan each minute .
san jose ; spanish : st. joseph is the third-largest city in california , the tenth-largest in the u.s. , and the county seat of santa clara county which is located at the southern end of san francisco
san jose is the largest city within silicon valley , which is a major component of the greater san francisco bay area , a region of 8.4 million people and the fifth largest metropolitan area csa in the
it is the largest city in northern california .
san jose was founded on november 29 , 1777 , as el pueblo de san jos ?? de guadalupe , the first civilian town in the spanish colony of nueva california , which later became alta california .
the city served as a farming community to support spanish military installations at san francisco and monterey .
when california gained statehood in 1850 , san jose served as its first capital .
after more than 150 years as a small farming city , san jose and the surrounding santa clara valley became the last and largest contiguous area of undeveloped land surrounding the san francisco bay .
san jose experienced increased demand for housing from soldiers and veterans returning from world war ii .
san jose then continued its aggressive expansion during the 1950s and 1960s by annexing more land area .
the rapid growth of the high-technology and electronics industries further accelerated the transition from an agricultural center , to an urbanized metropolitan area .
by the 1990s , san jose 's location within the booming local technology industry earned the city its nickname , capital of silicon valley .
san jose now maintains global city status and is the largest city in the san francisco bay area in terms of population , land area , and industrial development .
the u.s. census bureau reported the population of the city to be 945,942 as of the 2010 census .
as of april 2013 , the estimated population of san jose was 984,000 .
san jose , along with the santa clara valley , experienced about half a century of spectacular suburban sprawl , with characteristics of intense urbanization similar to the los angeles area of southern california .
the city has taken definite steps to avoid becoming `` l.a. north '' .
however , the sprawl in san jose is worse than in los angeles by measures such as population density and public transit safety , investment , and ridership .

it was first developed by siemens in the mid-1990s and introduced by mercedes-benz under the name `` keyless go '' in 1998 on the w220 s-class following its design patent filed by daimler-benz on may 17 , 1997 .
as a medical diagnosis , pedophilia or paedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in persons 16 years of age or older typically characterized by a primary or exclusive sexual interest toward prepubescent children generally age 11 years or younger ,
an adolescent who is 16 years of age or older must be at least five years older than the prepubescent child before the attraction can be diagnosed as pedophilia .
the term has a range of definitions , as found in psychiatry , psychology , the vernacular , and law enforcement .
the international classification of diseases icd defines pedophilia as a `` disorder of adult personality and behavior '' in which there is a sexual preference for children of prepubertal or early pubertal age .
according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm , it is a paraphilia in which adults or adolescents 16 years of age or older have intense and recurrent sexual urges towards and fantasies about prepubescent
in popular usage , pedophilia means any sexual interest in children or the act of child sexual abuse , often termed `` pedophilic behavior '' .
for example , the american heritage stedman 's medical dictionary states , `` pedophilia is the act or fantasy on the part of an adult of engaging in sexual activity with a child or children . ''
this common use application also extends to the sexual interest in and sexual contact with pubescent or post-pubescent minors .
researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided because although people who commit child sexual abuse commonly exhibit the disorder , some offenders do not meet the clinical diagnosis standards for pedophilia and these standards pertain to prepubescents .
additionally , not all pedophiles actually commit such abuse .
pedophilia was first formally recognized and named in the late 19th century .
a significant amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s .
although mostly documented in men , there are also women who exhibit the disorder , and researchers assume available estimates underrepresent the true number of female pedophiles .
no cure for pedophilia has been developed , but there are therapies that can reduce the incidence of a person committing child sexual abuse .
in the united states , following kansas v. hendricks , sex offenders who are diagnosed with certain mental disorders , particularly pedophilia , can be subject to indefinite civil commitment , under various state laws generically called svp laws
at present , the exact causes of pedophilia have not been conclusively established .
research suggests that pedophilia may be correlated with several different neurological abnormalities , and often co-exists with other personality disorders and psychological pathologies .
in the contexts of forensic psychology and law enforcement , a variety of typologies have been suggested to categorize pedophiles according to behavior and motivations .

of the nine million jews who had resided in europe before the holocaust , approximately two-thirds were killed .
over one million jewish children were killed in the holocaust , as were approximately two million jewish women and three million jewish men .
a network of over 40,000 facilities in germany and german-occupied territory were used to concentrate , hold , and kill jews and other victims .
some scholars argue that the mass murder of the romani and people with disabilities should be included in the definition , and some use the common noun `` holocaust '' to describe other nazi mass murders , including those of
recent estimates based on figures obtained since the fall of the soviet union indicates some ten to eleven million civilians and prisoners of war were intentionally murdered by the nazi regime .
the persecution and genocide were carried out in stages .
various laws to remove the jews from civil society , most prominently the nuremberg laws , were enacted in germany years before the outbreak of world war ii .
concentration camps were established in which inmates were subjected to slave labor until they died of exhaustion or disease .
where germany conquered new territory in eastern europe , specialized units called einsatzgruppen murdered jews and political opponents in mass shootings .
the occupiers required jews and romani to be confined in overcrowded ghettos before being transported by freight train to extermination camps where , if they survived the journey , most were systematically killed in gas chambers .
every arm of germany 's bureaucracy was involved in the logistics that led to the genocides , turning the third reich into what one holocaust scholar has called `` a genocidal state '' .

a silk-producing raspy cricket .
silk is a natural protein fiber , some forms of which can be woven into textiles .
the protein fiber of silk is composed mainly of fibroin and produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons .
the best-known type of silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm bombyx mori reared in captivity sericulture .
the shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism - like structure of the silk fiber , which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles , thus producing different colors .
silks are produced by several other insects , but generally only the silk of moth caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing .
there has been some research into other silks , which differ at the molecular level .
many silks are mainly produced by the larvae of insects undergoing complete metamorphosis , but some adult insects such as webspinners produce silk , and some insects such as raspy crickets produce silk throughout their lives .
silk production also occurs in hymenoptera bees , wasps , and ants , silverfish , mayflies , thrips , leafhoppers , beetles , lacewings , fleas , flies and midges .
other types of arthropod produce silk , most notably various arachnids such as spiders see spider silk .

cyberstalking is the use of the internet or other electronic means to stalk or harass an individual , a group of individuals , or an organization .
it may include the making of false accusations or statements of fact as in defamation , monitoring , making threats , identity theft , damage to data or equipment , the solicitation of minors for sex , or
the definition of `` harassment '' must meet the criterion that a reasonable person , in possession of the same information , would regard it as sufficient to cause another reasonable person distress .
cyberstalking is different from spatial or offline stalking in that it occurs through the use of electronic communications technology such as the internet .
however , it sometimes leads to it , or is accompanied by it .
both are criminal offenses .
cyberstalking shares important characteristics with offline stalking .
many stalkers ??? online or off ??? are motivated by a desire to control their victims .
a cyberstalker may be an online stranger or a person whom the target knows .
a cyberstalker may be anonymous and may solicit involvement of other people online who do not even know the target .

a cyberstalking conviction can result in a restraining order , probation , or even criminal penalties against the assailant , including jail .
tilapia is the common name for nearly a hundred species of cichlid fish from the tilapiine cichlid tribe .
tilapia are mainly freshwater fish , inhabiting shallow streams , ponds , rivers and lakes , and less commonly found living in brackish water .
historically , they have been of major importance in artisan fishing in africa and the levant , and are of increasing importance in aquaculture .
tilapia can become problematic invasive species in new warm-water habitats , whether deliberately or accidentally introduced , but generally not in temperate climates due to their inability to survive in cooler waters below about .

agriculture is a major industry in the united states and the country is a net exporter of food .
as of the last census of agriculture in 2007 , there were 2.2 million farms , covering an area of , an average of per farm .
although agricultural activity occurs in most states , it is particularly concentrated in the vast expanse of flat , arable land known as the great plains , which encompasses the central region of the nation .
the mpemba effect , named after tanzanian student erasto mpemba , is the assertion that warmer water can freeze faster than colder water .
although there is anecdotal support for the effect , there is no agreement on exactly what the effect is and under what circumstances it occurs .
there have been reports of similar phenomena since ancient times , although with insufficient detail for the claims to be replicated .
the phenomenon seems contrary to thermodynamics , but a number of possible explanations for the effect have been proposed .
further investigations will need to decide on a precise definition of `` freezing '' and control a vast number of starting parameters in order to confirm or explain the effect .

in economics , the money supply or money stock , is the total amount of monetary assets available in an economy at a specific time .
there are several ways to define `` money , '' but standard measures usually include currency in circulation and demand deposits depositors ' easily accessed assets on the books of financial institutions .
money supply data are recorded and published , usually by the government or the central bank of the country .
public and private sector analysts have long monitored changes in money supply because of its effects on the price level , inflation , the exchange rate and the business cycle .
that relation between money and prices is historically associated with the quantity theory of money .
there is strong empirical evidence of a direct relation between money-supply growth and long-term price inflation , at least for rapid increases in the amount of money in the economy .
that is , a country such as zimbabwe which saw rapid increases in its money supply also saw rapid increases in prices hyperinflation .
this is one reason for the reliance on monetary policy as a means of controlling inflation .
the nature of this causal chain is the subject of contention .
some heterodox economists argue that the money supply is endogenous determined by the workings of the economy , not by the central bank and that the sources of inflation must be found in the distributional structure of the
in addition , those economists seeing the central bank 's control over the money supply as feeble say that there are two weak links between the growth of the money supply and the inflation rate .
first , in the aftermath of a recession , when many resources are underutilized , an increase in the money supply can cause a sustained increase in real production instead of inflation .
second , if the velocity of money , i.e. , the ratio between nominal gdp and money supply , changes , an increase in the money supply could have either no effect , an exaggerated effect , or an unpredictable

the rate of intake for cold foods has been studied as a contributing factor .
there are people who can not experience `` brain freeze '' or similar symptoms .
the term ice-cream headache has been in use since at least 31 january 1937 , contained in a journal entry by rebecca timbres published in the 1939 book we did n't ask utopia : a quaker family in soviet russia
the first published use of the term brain freeze , as it pertains to cold-induced headaches , was on 27 may 1991 .
`` auld lang syne '' : note `` s '' rather than `` z '' is a scots poem written by robert burns in 1788 and set to the tune of a traditional folk song roud #
it is well known in many countries , especially in the english-speaking world ; its traditional use being to celebrate the start of the new year at the stroke of midnight .
by extension , it is also sung at funerals , graduations and as a farewell or ending to other occasions .
the international boy scout youth movement , in many countries , uses it as a close to jamborees and other functions .
the song 's scots title may be translated into english literally as `` old long since '' , or more idiomatically , `` long long ago '' , `` days gone by '' or `` old times '' .
consequently `` for auld lang syne '' , as it appears in the first line of the chorus , might be loosely translated as `` for the sake of old times '' .
the phrase `` auld lang syne '' is also used in similar poems by robert ayton 1570 ??? 1638 , allan ramsay 1686 ??? 1757 , and james watson 1711 as well as older
matthew fitt uses the phrase `` in the days of auld lang syne '' as the equivalent of '' once upon a time ...
'' in his retelling of fairy tales in the scots language .

in baseball , hitting for the cycle is the accomplishment of one batter hitting a single , a double , a triple , and a home run in the same game .
collecting the hits in that order is known as a `` natural cycle '' .
cycles are uncommon in major league baseball mlb , and have occurred 294 times since the first by curry foley in 1882 .
the cycle is roughly as common as a no-hitter 279 occurrences in mlb history ; it has been called `` one of the rarest '' and `` most difficult feats '' in baseball .
based on 2009 offensive levels , the probability of an average mlb player hitting for a cycle against an average team in a game is approximately 0.00590 % ; this corresponds to about 2.5 cycles in a 162-game season with
in other baseball leagues , the cycle is achieved less frequently .
through september 4 , 2008 , 62 players in nippon professional baseball npb , the top-level baseball organization in japan , have hit for the cycle , the most recent being michihiro ogasawara .
two players have hit for the cycle on the same day once in npb history ; this has occurred twice in mlb history .

site of the menelaion , the shrine to helen and menelaus constructed anciently in the bronze age city that stood on the hill of therapne on the left bank of the eurotas river overlooking the future site of dorian sparta
across the valley the successive ridges of mount taygetus are in evidence .
sparta doric greek : ; attic greek : , or lacedaemon , was a prominent city-state in ancient greece , situated on the banks of the eurotas river in laconia , in south-eastern peloponnese .
it emerged as a political entity around the 10th century bc , when the invading dorians subjugated the local , non-dorian population .
around 650 bc , it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient greece .
given its military pre-eminence , sparta was recognized as the overall leader of the combined greek forces during the greco-persian wars .
between 431 and 404 bc , sparta was the principal enemy of athens during the peloponnesian war , from which it emerged victorious , though at great cost .
sparta 's defeat by thebes in the battle of leuctra in 371 bc ended sparta 's prominent role in greece .
however , it maintained its political independence until the roman conquest of greece in 146 bc .
it then underwent a long period of decline , especially in the middle ages , when many spartans moved to live in mystras .
modern sparta is the capital of the greek regional unit of laconia and a center for the processing of goods such as citrus and olives .
sparta was unique in ancient greece for its social system and constitution , which completely focused on military training and excellence .
its inhabitants were classified as spartiates spartan citizens , who enjoyed full rights , mothakes non-spartan free men raised as spartans , perioikoi freedmen , and helots state-owned serfs , enslaved non-spartan local
spartiates underwent the rigorous agoge training and education regimen , and spartan phalanges were widely considered to be among the best in battle .
spartan women enjoyed considerably more rights and equality to men than elsewhere in the classical world .
sparta was the subject of fascination in its own day , as well as in the west following the revival of classical learning .
this love or admiration of sparta is known as laconism or laconophilia .

a gold bar is a quantity of refined metallic gold of any shape that is made by a bar producer meeting standard conditions of manufacture , labeling , and record keeping .
larger gold bars that are produced by pouring the molten metal into molds are called ingots .
smaller bars may be manufactured by minting or stamping from appropriately rolled gold sheets .
the standard gold bar held as gold reserves by central banks and traded among bullion dealers is the 400-troy-ounce 12.4 kg or 438.9 ounces good delivery gold bar .
the kilobar , which is to say 1000 grams in mass , is the bar that is more manageable and is used extensively for trading and investment .
the premium on these bars when traded is very low over the spot value of the gold making it ideal for small transfers between banks and traders .
most kilobars are flat , although some investors , particularly in europe , prefer the brick shape .

the flag of mexico spanish : bandera de m ?? xico is a vertical tricolor of green , white , and red with the national coat of arms charged in the center of the white stripe .
while the meaning of the colors has changed over time , these three colors were adopted by mexico following independence from spain during the country 's war of independence , and subsequent first mexican empire .
the current flag was adopted in 1968 , but the overall design has been used since 1821 , when the first national flag was created .
the current law of national symbols , law on the national arms , flag , and anthem , that governs the use of the national flag has been in place since 1984 .
red , white , and green are the colors of the national liberation army in mexico .
the central emblem is the aztec pictogram for tenochtitlan now mexico city , the center of their empire .
it recalls the legend that inspired the aztecs to settle on what was originally a lake-island .
the form of the coat of arms was most recently revised in 1968 .
a ribbon in the national colors is at the bottom of the coat of arms .
throughout history , the flag has changed four times , as the design of the coat of arms and the length-width ratios of the flag have been modified .
however , the coat of arms has had the same features throughout : an eagle , holding a serpent in its talon , is perched on top of a prickly pear cactus ; the cactus is situated on a rock
the coat of arms is derived from an aztec legend that their gods told them to build a city where they spot an eagle on a nopal eating a serpent , which is now mexico city .
the current national flag , the fourth national flag , is also used as the mexican naval ensign by ships registered in mexico .
the elk or wapiti cervus canadensis is one of the largest species of deer in the world , and one of the largest land mammals in north america and eastern asia .
it was long believed to be a subspecies of the european red deer cervus elaphus , but evidence from a 2004 study of the mitochondrial dna indicates that the two are distinct species .
this animal should not be confused with the larger moose alces alces , to which the name `` elk '' applies in eurasia .
apart from the moose , the only other member of the deer family to rival the elk in size is the south asian sambar rusa unicolor .
elk range in forest and forest-edge habitat , feeding on grasses , plants , leaves , and bark .
although native to north america and eastern asia , they have adapted well to countries where they have been introduced , including argentina , australia , and new zealand .
their great adaptability may threaten endemic species and ecosystems into which they have been introduced .
male elk have large antlers which are shed each year .
males also engage in ritualized mating behaviors during the rut , including posturing , antler wrestling sparring , and bugling , a loud series of vocalizations which establishes dominance over other males and attracts females .
elk are susceptible to a number of infectious diseases , some of which can be transmitted to livestock .
efforts to eliminate infectious diseases from elk populations , largely through vaccination , have had mixed success .
some cultures revere the elk as a spiritual force .
in parts of asia , antlers and their velvet are used in traditional medicines .
elk are hunted as a game species ; the meat is leaner and higher in protein than beef or chicken .

the human lungs are the organs of respiration in humans .
humans have two lungs , a right lung and a left lung .
the right lung consists of three lobes while the left lung is slightly smaller consisting of only two lobes the left lung has a `` cardiac notch '' allowing space for the heart within the chest .
together , the lungs contain approximately of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli , having a total surface area of about in adults ??? roughly the same area as one side of a tennis court .
furthermore , if all of the capillaries that surround the alveoli were unwound and laid end to end , they would extend for about .
each lung weighs , therefore making the entire organ about .
human lungs
the trachea divides into two bronchi one for each side at the level of t4 .
this junction is also known as the carina .
the conducting zone contains the trachea , the bronchi , the bronchioles , and the terminal bronchioles the respiratory zone contains the respiratory bronchioles , the alveolar ducts , and the alveoli .
the conducting zone and the respiratory stuffers but not the alveoli are made up of airways .
the conducting zone has no gas exchange with the blood , and is reinforced with cartilage in order to hold open the airways .
the conducting zone warms the air to and humidifies the air .
it also cleanses the air by removing particles via cilia located on the walls of all the passageways .
the lungs are surrounded by the rib cage .
the respiratory zone is the site of gas exchange with blood .
the sympathetic nervous system via noradrenaline acting on the beta receptors causes bronchodilation .
the parasympathetic nervous system via acetylcholine , which acts on the m-3 muscarinic receptors , maintains the resting tone of the bronchiolar smooth muscle .
this action is related , although considered distinct from bronchoconstriction .
many other non-autonomic nervous and biochemical stimuli , including carbon dioxide and oxygen , are also involved in the regulation process .
the pleural cavity is the potential space between the parietal pleura , lining the inner wall of the thoracic cage , and the visceral pleura lining the lungs .
the lung parenchyma is strictly used to refer solely to alveolar tissue with respiratory bronchioles , alveolar ducts and terminal bronchioles .

pawn in the standard staunton pattern
the pawn ?????? is the most numerous and in most circumstances the weakest piece in the game of chess , historically representing infantry or , more particularly , armed peasants or pikemen .
in chess , each player begins the game with eight pawns , one on each square of the rank immediately in front of the other pieces .
-lrb- in algebraic notation , the white pawns start on a2 , b2 , c2 , ... , h2 , while black pawns start on a7 , b7 , c7 , ... , h7 .
individual pawns are referred to by the file on which they stand .
for example , one speaks of `` white 's f-pawn '' or `` black 's b-pawn '' , or less commonly using descriptive notation , `` white 's king 's bishop pawn '' or `` black 's queen
it is also common to refer to a rook pawn , meaning any pawn on the a - or h-file , a knight pawn on the b - or g-file , a bishop pawn on the c

hydrogen production is the family of industrial methods for generating hydrogen .
currently the dominant technology for direct production is steam reforming from hydrocarbons .
many other methods are known including electrolysis and thermolysis .
in 2006 , the united states was estimated to have a production capacity of 11 million tonnes of hydrogen .
5 million tonnes of hydrogen were consumed on-site in oil refining , and in the production of ammonia haber process and methanol reduction of carbon monoxide .
0.4 million tonnes were an incidental by-product of the chlor-alkali process .
hydrogen production is an estimated $ 100 billion industry .
a basis point often denoted as bp , colloquially referred to in the plural as `` bips '' , also known as a `` beep '' is a unit equal to one hundredth of a percentage point ,
the same unit is also rarely called a permyriad , literally meaning ` for every myriad ten thousand ' , and in that context is written with which looks like a percent sign
a basis point is defined as :
1 basis point = 1 permyriad = one one-hundredth percent
1 bp = 1 = 0.01 % = 0.1 ??? = 10 ??? 4 = = 0.0001
1 % = 100 bp = 100
basis points are used as a convenient unit of measurement in contexts where percentage differences of less than 1 % are discussed .
the most common example is interest rates , where differences in interest rates of less than 1 % per year are usually meaningful to talk about .
for example , a difference of 0.10 percentage points is equivalent to a change of 10 basis points e.g. a 4.67 % rate increases by 10 basis points to 4.77 % .
like percentage points , basis points avoid the ambiguity between relative and absolute discussions about interest rates by dealing only with the absolute change in numeric value of a rate .
for example , if a report says there has been a `` 1 % increase '' from a 10 % interest rate , this could refer to an increase either from 10 % to 10.1 % relative , 1
if , however , the report says there has been a `` 10 basis point increase '' from a 10 % interest rate , then we know that the interest rate of 10 % has increased by 0.10 %
it is common practice in the financial industry to use basis points to denote a rate change in a financial instrument , or the difference spread between two interest rates , including the yields of fixed-income securities .
since certain loans and bonds may commonly be quoted in relation to some index or underlying security , they will often be quoted as a spread over or under the index .
for example , a loan that bears interest of 0.50 % per annum above the london interbank offered rate libor is said to be 50 basis points over libor , which is commonly expressed as `` l +50
the term `` basis point '' has its origins in trading the `` basis '' or the spread between two interest rates .
since the basis is usually small , these are quoted multiplied up by 10000 , and hence a `` full point '' movement in the `` basis '' is a basis point .
contrast with pips in fx forward markets .
the relationship between percentage changes and basis points can be summarized as follows : 1 percentage point change = 100 basis points , and 0.01 percentage points = 1 basis point .
so , a bond whose yield increases from 5 % to 5.5 % is said to increase by 50 basis points ; or interest rates that have risen 1 percentage point are said to have increased by 100 basis points

the draupner wave , a single giant wave measured on new year 's day 1995 , finally confirmed the existence of freak waves , which had previously been considered near-mythical
rogue waves also known as freak waves , monster waves , killer waves , extreme waves , and abnormal waves are relatively large and spontaneous ocean surface waves that occur far out at sea , and are a
in oceanography , they are more precisely defined as waves whose height is more than twice the significant wave height swh , which is itself defined as the mean of the largest third of waves in a wave
therefore rogue waves are not necessarily the biggest waves found at sea ; they are , rather , surprisingly large waves for a given sea state .
rogue waves seem not to have a single distinct cause , but occur where physical factors such as high winds and strong currents cause waves to merge to create a single exceptionally large wave .

the main causes of world war ii were nationalistic issues , unresolved issues , and resentments resulting from world war i and the interwar period in europe , in addition to the effects of the great depression in the 1930s
the culmination of events that led to the outbreak of war are generally understood to be the 1939 invasion of poland by germany and soviet russia and the 1937 invasion of the republic of china by the empire of japan
these military aggressions were the result of decisions made by the authoritarian ruling nazi elite in germany and by the leadership of the kwantung army in japan .

myasthenia gravis from greek ?????? `` muscle '' , `` weakness '' , and `` serious '' ; abbreviated mg is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability .
it is an autoimmune disorder , in which weakness is caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction , inhibiting the excitatory effects of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine on nicotinic receptors throughout neuromuscular junctions .
myasthenia is treated medically with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or immunosuppressants , and , in selected cases , thymectomy .
the disease incidence is 3 ??? 30 cases per million per year and rising as a result of increased awareness .
mg must be distinguished from congenital myasthenic syndromes that can present similar symptoms but offer no response to immunosuppressive treatments .

dubai ; ' , is a city in the united arab emirates , located within the emirate of the same name .
the emirate of dubai is located on the southeast coast of the persian gulf on the arabian peninsula and is one of the seven emirates that make up the country .
it has the largest population in the uae 2,106,177 and the second-largest land territory by area 4,114 km2 after abu dhabi .
dubai and abu dhabi , the national capital , are the only two emirates to have veto power over critical matters of national importance in the country 's legislature .
the city of dubai is located on the emirate 's northern coastline and heads up the dubai-sharjah-ajman metropolitan area .
dubai is nowadays often misperceived as a country or city-state and , in some cases , the uae as a whole has been described as ` dubai ' .
the earliest mention of dubai is in 1095 ad , and the earliest recorded settlement in the region dates from 1799 .
the sheikhdom of dubai was formally established in 1833 by sheikh maktoum bin butti al-maktoum when he persuaded around 800 members of his tribe of the bani yas , living in what was then the second saudi state and now
it remained under the tribe 's control when the united kingdom assumed protection of the sheikhdom in 1892 and joined the nascent united arab emirates upon independence in 1971 as the country 's second emirate .
its strategic geographic location made the town an important trading hub and by the beginning of the 20th century , dubai was already an important regional port .
today , dubai has emerged as a cosmopolitan metropolis that has grown steadily to become a global city and a business and cultural hub of the middle east and the persian gulf region .
although dubai 's economy was historically built on the oil industry , the emirate 's western-style model of business drives its economy with the main revenues now coming from tourism , real estate , and financial services .
dubai has recently attracted world attention through many innovative large construction projects and sports events .
the city has become symbolic for its skyscrapers and high-rise buildings , such as the world 's tallest burj khalifa , in addition to ambitious development projects including man-made islands , hotels , and some of the largest shopping malls
this increased attention has also highlighted labor and human rights issues concerning the city 's largely south asian paid workforce .
dubai 's property market experienced a major deterioration in 2008 ??? 2009 as a result of the worldwide economic downturn following the financial crisis of 2007-2008 .
however , dubai has made a steady and gradual recovery with help coming from neighboring emirates .
the handful of new projects that are in the pipeline have been able to help dubai real estate make a comeback .
as of 2012 , dubai is the 22nd most expensive city in the world , and the most expensive city in the middle east , surpassing israel 's tel aviv 31st .
dubai has also been rated as one of the best places to live in the middle east , including by us american global consulting firm mercer who rated the city as the best place to live in the middle east

an ocean ; the world ocean of classical antiquity is a body of saline water that composes a large part of a planet 's hydrosphere .
in the context of earth , it refers to one or all of the major divisions of the planet 's world ocean ??? they are , in descending order of area , the pacific , atlantic , indian , southern
the word '' sea '' is often used interchangeably with `` ocean '' , but strictly speaking a sea is a body of saline water possibly a division of the world ocean partly or fully enclosed by land
earth is the only planet known to have an ocean or any large amounts of open liquid water .
approximately 72 % of the planet 's surface ~ 3.6 x108 km2 is covered by saline water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas , with the ocean covering approximately 71 % of the
in terms of the hydrosphere of the earth , the ocean contains 97 % of the earth 's water .
oceanographers have stated that out of 97 % , only 5 % of the ocean as a whole on earth has been explored .
because it is the principal component of earth 's hydrosphere , the world ocean is integral to all known life , forms part of the carbon cycle , and influences climate and weather patterns .
the total volume is approximately 1.3 billion cubic kilometres 310 million cu mi with an average depth of .
it is the habitat of 230,000 known species , although much of the ocean 's depths remain unexplored and it is estimated that over two million marine species exist .
the origin of earth 's oceans is still unknown , but oceans are believed to have formed in the hadean period and may have been the impetus for the emergence of life .
extraterrestrial oceans may be composed of a wide range of elements and compounds .
the only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of titan , although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the solar system .
early in their geologic histories , mars and venus are theorized to have had large water oceans .
the mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of mars was once covered by water , though the water on mars is no longer oceanic , and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the
compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point , so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice .
unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites ; notably , the ocean of europa is believed to have over twice the water volume of earth .
the solar system 's gas giant planets are also believed to possess liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions .
oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons , including surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone .
ocean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid .
a glass of root beer with foam
root beer is a carbonated , sweetened beverage , originally made using the root of a sassafras plant or the bark of a sassafras tree as the primary flavor .
root beer , popularized in north america , comes in two forms : alcoholic and soft drink .
the historical root beer was analogous to small beer in that the process provided a drink with a very low alcohol content .
although roots are used as the source of many soft drinks throughout the world , often different names are used .
informal logic , intuitively , refers to the principles of logic and logical thought outside of a formal setting .
however , perhaps because of the informal in the title , the precise definition of informal logic is a matter of some dispute .
ralph h. johnson and j. anthony blair define informal logic as `` a branch of logic whose task is to develop non-formal standards , criteria , procedures for the analysis , interpretation , evaluation , criticism and construction of argumentation
this definition reflects what had been implicit in their practice and what others were doing in their informal logic texts .
informal logic is associated with informal fallacies , critical thinking , the thinking skills movement and the interdisciplinary inquiry known as argumentation theory .
frans h. van eemeren writes that the label `` informal logic '' covers a `` collection of normative approaches to the study of reasoning in ordinary language that remain closer to the practice of argumentation than formal logic . ''
turkey , officially the republic of turkey , is a transcontinental country , located mostly on anatolia in western asia and on east thrace in southeastern europe .
turkey is bordered by eight countries : bulgaria to the northwest ; greece to the west ; georgia to the northeast ; armenia , iran and the azerbaijani exclave of nakhchivan to the east ; and iraq and syria to
the mediterranean sea is to the south ; the aegean sea is to the west ; and the black sea is to the north .
the sea of marmara , the bosphorus and the dardanelles which together form the turkish straits demarcate the boundary between thrace and anatolia ; they also separate europe and asia .
turkey 's location at the crossroads of europe and asia makes it a country of significant geostrategic importance .
the country 's official language is turkish , a turkic language , which is spoken by approximately 85 % of the population as mother tongue .
the most numerous ethnic group is the turks , who constitute between 70 % and 75 % of the population according to the world factbook .
kurds are the largest ethnic minority and , according to the same source , number around 18 % of the population while other ethnic minorities are estimated to be at 7 ??? 12 % .
the vast majority of the population is muslim .
the area now called turkey has been inhabited since the paleolithic , including various ancient anatolian civilizations and thracian peoples .
after alexander the great 's conquest , the area was hellenized , which continued with the roman rule and the transition into the byzantine empire .
the seljuk turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , starting the process of turkification , which was greatly accelerated by the seljuk victory over the byzantines at the battle of manzikert in 1071 .
the seljuk sultanate of r ?? m ruled anatolia until the mongol invasion in 1243 , upon which it disintegrated into several small turkish beyliks .
starting from the late 13th century , the ottoman beylik united anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of southeastern europe , western asia and north africa .
after the ottoman empire collapsed following its defeat in world war i , parts of it were occupied by the victorious allies .
a cadre of young military officers , led by mustafa kemal atat ?? rk and his colleagues , organized a successful resistance to the allies ; in 1923 they established the modern republic of turkey , with atat ?? rk
turkey is a democratic , secular , unitary , constitutional republic with a diverse cultural heritage .

turkey has also fostered close cultural , political and economic relations with the middle east , caucasus , the turkic states of central asia and the african countries through membership in organizations such as the turkic council , joint administration
turkey 's growing economy and diplomatic initiatives have led to its recognition as a regional power .
turkey is the world 's 17th largest economy by nominal gdp and the 16th largest by purchasing power parity .

an animated diagram of a cutter
in baseball , a cutter , or cut fastball , is a type of fastball which breaks slightly toward the pitcher 's glove side as it reaches home plate .
this pitch is somewhere between a slider and a fastball , as it is usually thrown faster than a slider but with more motion than a typical fastball .
some pitchers use a cutter as a way to prevent hitters from expecting their regular fastballs .
a common technique used to throw a cutter is to use a four-seam fastball grip with the baseball set slightly off center in the hand .
when a batter is able to hit a cutter pitch , it often results in soft contact and an easy out , due to the pitch 's movement keeping the ball away from the bat 's sweet spot .
the cutter is typically 2 ??? 5 mph slower than a pitcher 's four-seam fastball .
in 2010 , the average pitch classified as a cutter by pitchf\/x thrown by a right-handed pitcher was 88.6 mph ; the average four-seamer was 92.1 mph .

philosopher plato by silanion
the humanities are academic disciplines that study human culture , using methods that are primarily analytical , critical , or speculative , and having a significant historical element , as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences
the humanities include ancient and modern languages , literature , philosophy , religion , and visual and performing arts such as music and theater .
the humanities that are also regarded as social sciences include history , anthropology , area studies , communication studies , cultural studies , law , economics and linguistics .
scholars working in the humanities are sometimes described as `` humanists '' .
however , that term also describes the philosophical position of humanism , which some '' antihumanist '' scholars in the humanities reject .
some secondary schools offer humanities classes , usually consisting of english literature , global studies , and art .
human disciplines like history , cultural anthropology and psychoanalysis study subject matters to which the experimental method does not apply , and they have access instead to the comparative method and comparative research .

schizophrenia or is a mental disorder characterized by a breakdown of thought processes and by a deficit of typical emotional responses .
common symptoms include auditory hallucinations , paranoid or bizarre delusions , or disorganized speech and thinking , and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction .
the onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood , with a global lifetime prevalence of about 0.3 ??? 0.7 % .
diagnosis is based on observed behavior and the patient 's reported experiences .
genetics , early environment , neurobiology , and psychological and social processes appear to be important contributory factors ; some recreational and prescription drugs appear to cause or worsen symptoms .
current research is focused on the role of neurobiology , although no single isolated organic cause has been found .
the many possible combinations of symptoms have triggered debate about whether the diagnosis represents a single disorder or a number of discrete syndromes .
despite the etymology of the term from the greek roots skhizein ?????????????? , `` to split '' and phr ?? n , phren - ???????? , ???????? - ; `` mind '' , schizophrenia does not
rather , the term means a `` splitting of mental functions '' , because of the symptomatic presentation of the illness .
the mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication , which primarily suppresses dopamine and sometimes serotonin receptor activity .
psychotherapy and vocational and social rehabilitation are also important in treatment .
in more serious cases ??? where there is risk to self and others ??? involuntary hospitalization may be necessary , although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were .
the disorder is thought mainly to affect cognition , but it also usually contributes to chronic problems with behavior and emotion .
people with schizophrenia are likely to have additional comorbid conditions , including major depression and anxiety disorders ; the lifetime occurrence of substance use disorder is almost 50 % .
social problems , such as long-term unemployment , poverty , and homelessness are common .
the average life expectancy of people with the disorder is 12 to 15 years less than those without , the result of increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate about 5 % .

weather is the state of the atmosphere , to the degree that it is hot or cold , wet or dry , calm or stormy , clear or cloudy .
most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere , just below the stratosphere .
weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity , whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time .
when used without qualification , `` weather '' is understood to be the weather of earth .
weather is driven by air pressure temperature and moisture differences between one place and another .
these pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot , which varies by latitude from the tropics .
the strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream .
weather systems in the mid-latitudes , such as extratropical cyclones , are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow .
because the earth 's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane , sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year .
on earth 's surface , temperatures usually range ?? 40 ?? c ??? 40 ?? f to 100 ?? f annually .
over thousands of years , changes in earth 's orbit affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the earth and influence long-term climate and global climate change .
surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences .
higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating .
weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location .
the atmosphere is a chaotic system , so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole .
human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history , and there is evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry has inadvertently modified weather patterns .
studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on earth .
a famous landmark in the solar system , jupiter 's great red spot , is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years .
however , weather is not limited to planetary bodies .
a star 's corona is constantly being lost to space , creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the solar system .

the following is a list of sovereign states and territories where english is an official language or language of government .
in 2012 , there were 88 states in total 60 sovereign states and 28 non-sovereign states .
in many countries english is the dominant language , but does not have official status .
in australia , english is spoken by the vast majority of the population and is the only language used in government institutions , but australia does not have an official language .
the case is the same in the united kingdom and the united states , though many states and regions within the u.s. do have english as an official language .
english is the dominant language of new zealand and an official language of canada along with french , india along with hindi and several other languages , ireland along with irish , and the
english is the sole official language of the commonwealth of nations and the commonwealth games .
english is one of the official languages of the united nations , the european union and the international olympic committee .
many of these countries are current or former colonies or dependencies of the united kingdom see also british empire , or of the united states , itself a former colony of the uk .
notable exceptions include rwanda , which was a former belgian colony and eritrea , which was an italian colony where the british empire spanned its control only in world war ii and shortly after 1941-1952 .
india 's linguistic picture is complex .
according to the constitution of india , '' hindi in the devanagari script '' is the official language of the union ; and english the ` subsidiary official language ' ; however , english is mandated for the authoritative texts
english is used almost exclusively for higher education , business and science .
courses in majority of the schools are taught exclusively in english .
english is extensively used for administrative purposes in india .
india is the second-largest english-speaking country in the world by number of speakers , after the united states .
as such , many consider english to be the de facto official language of india .

although geographically this includes southern and part of southeast s ?? o paulo of brazil , in terms of political geography the southern cone has traditionally comprised argentina , chile , paraguay , and uruguay .
in the narrowest sense , it only covers argentina , chile and uruguay , bounded on the north by the states of brazil , paraguay , bolivia and peru , on the west by the pacific ocean , and south

an official game in baseball , also sometimes called a regulation game , is a game that has progressed beyond the point at which it can be considered complete if necessary .
this is approximately the halfway point of the game .
in the case of inclement weather , any game which has reached this point may be stopped and shortened as needed , with the result being final , and all records and statistics counted .
a game which has not reached this point before being stopped is either considered a suspended game to be continued at a later date from the point of stoppage , or is simply canceled and replayed from the
-lrb- this depends on the rules of each individual league .
in either case , no statistics are counted until the game becomes official .
since most professional baseball games are nine innings long , the fifth inning is used as the threshold for an official game .
if the visiting team is leading , or the game is tied , the end of the fifth inning marks this point .
if the home team which bats last is already ahead in the score , and theoretically would not need its half of the fifth inning , then 41 ??? 2 innings i.e. , the middle of the
the game is also considered official if the home team scores to take the lead in the bottom of the fifth inning , since the game would end immediately if the same thing happened in the ninth .
in nearly all cases , the `` official game '' status is used to determine whether a rain check will be honored for fans holding tickets .
if a game is started but does not reach the point of becoming official , fans are entitled to a new ticket for the make-up game or in most cases any other available game of their choice .
if a game is halted after it becomes official , the game is simply shortened and no rain check is given .
the `` official game '' statistic received some attention during the 1995 season , when cal ripken , jr. was approaching the record for consecutive games played , previously held by lou gehrig .
large numbers were hung on the side of the b&o warehouse at oriole park at camden yards to show the number of games in ripken 's streak .
each day , a new number was unfurled during the fifth inning after each game had become official since the statistic would not have counted if the game had been stopped before that point .
a similar practice has been used to count down toward the demolition of several stadiums including veterans stadium in philadelphia in 2003 , busch memorial stadium in st. louis in 2005 , and the original yankee stadium and shea
1st special forces operational detachment-delta 1st sfod-d , popularly known as delta force , is one of the united states ' four secretive tier-one counter-terrorism and special mission units .
it was formerly listed as the combat applications group by the department of defense but has since been officially re-designated the army compartmented elements ace .
while 1st sfod-d is administratively supported by usasoc , it falls under the operational control of the joint special operations command .
delta force and its navy counterpart , the naval special warfare development group , are the united states military 's primary counter-terrorism units .
delta force 's primary tasks are counter-terrorism , direct action , and national intervention operations , although it is an extremely versatile group capable of conducting many types of covert missions , including , but not limited to , hostage

a season is a subdivision of the year , marked by changes in weather , ecology , and hours of daylight .
seasons result from the yearly revolution of the earth around the sun and the tilt of the earth 's axis relative to the plane of revolution .
in temperate and polar regions , the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the earth 's surface , variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate , and plants
during may , june and july , the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun .
the same is true of the southern hemisphere in november , december and january .
it is the tilt of the earth that causes the sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux .
however , due to seasonal lag , june , july and august are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and december , january and february are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere .
in temperate and subpolar regions , generally four calendar - based seasons with their adjectives are recognized : spring vernal , summer estival , autumn autumnal and winter hibernal .
however , ecologists mostly use a six season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring prevernal and late summer serotinal as distinct seasons along with the traditional four .
hot regions have two or three seasons ; the rainy or wet , or monsoon season and the dry season , and in some tropical areas , a cool or mild season .
in some parts of the world , special `` seasons '' are loosely defined based on important events such as a hurricane season , tornado season or a wildfire season .

hepatitis c is an infectious disease affecting primarily the liver , caused by the hepatitis c virus hcv .
the infection is often asymptomatic , but chronic infection can lead to scarring of the liver and ultimately to cirrhosis , which is generally apparent after many years .
in some cases , those with cirrhosis will go on to develop liver failure , liver cancer or life-threatening esophageal and gastric varices .
hcv is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use , poorly sterilized medical equipment and transfusions .
an estimated 130 ??? 200 million people worldwide are infected with .
the existence of originally `` non - a non - b hepatitis '' was postulated in the 1970s and proven in 1989 .
only infects humans and chimpanzees .
the virus persists in the liver in about 85 % of those infected .
this persistent infection can be treated with medication : the standard therapy is a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin , with either boceprevir or telaprevir added in some cases .
overall , 50 ??? 80 % of people treated are cured .
those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant .

a flexible spending account fsa , also known as a flexible spending arrangement , is one of a number of tax-advantaged financial accounts that can be set up through a cafeteria plan of an employer in the united
an fsa allows an employee to set aside a portion of earnings to pay for qualified expenses as established in the cafeteria plan , most commonly for medical expenses but often for dependent care or other expenses .
money deducted from an employee 's pay into an fsa is not subject to payroll taxes , resulting in substantial payroll tax savings .
one significant disadvantage to using an fsa is that funds not used by the end of the plan year are lost to the employee , known as the `` use it or lose it '' rule .
the most common type of flexible spending account , the medical expense fsa also medical fsa or health fsa , is similar to a health savings account hsa or a health reimbursement account hra
however , while hsas and hras are almost exclusively used as components of a consumer driven health care plan , medical fsas are commonly offered with more traditional health plans as well .
in addition , funds in a health savings account are not lost when the plan year is over , unlike funds in an fsa .
paper forms or an fsa debit card , also known as a flexcard , may be used to access the account funds .
tennessee is a u.s. state located in the southeastern united states .
tennessee is the 36th most extensive and the 17th most populous of the 50 united states .
tennessee is bordered by kentucky and virginia to the north , north carolina to the east , georgia , alabama , and mississippi to the south , and arkansas and missouri to the west .
the appalachian mountains dominate the eastern part of the state , and the mississippi river forms the state 's western border .
tennessee 's capital and second largest city is nashville , which has a population of 609,644 .
memphis is the state 's largest city , with a population of 652,050 .
the state of tennessee is rooted in the watauga association , a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the appalachians .
what is now tennessee was initially part of north carolina , and later part of the southwest territory .
tennessee was admitted to the union as the 16th state on june 1 , 1796 .
tennessee was the last state to leave the union and join the confederacy at the outbreak of the u.s. civil war in 1861 , and the first state to be readmitted to the union at the end of the war
tennessee furnished more soldiers for the confederate army than any other state , and more soldiers for the union army than any other southern state .
in the 20th century , tennessee transitioned from an agrarian economy to a more diversified economy , aided at times by federal entities such as the tennessee valley authority .
in the early 1940s , the city of oak ridge was established to house the manhattan project 's uranium enrichment facilities , helping to build the world 's first atomic bomb .
tennessee has played a critical role in the development of many forms of american popular music , including rock and roll , blues , country , and rockabilly .
beale street in memphis is considered by many to be the birthplace of the blues , with musicians such as w.c. handy performing in its clubs as early as 1909 .
memphis was also home to sun records , where musicians such as elvis presley , isaac hayes , johnny cash , carl perkins , jerry lee lewis , roy orbison , and charlie rich began their recording careers , and
the 1927 victor recording sessions in bristol generally mark the beginning of the country music genre and the rise of the grand ole opry in the 1930s helped make nashville the center of the country music recording industry .
three bricks and mortar museums recognize tennessee 's role in nurturing various forms of popular music : the memphis rock n ' soul museum , the country music hall of fame and museum in nashville , and the international rock-a-billy
in addition , the rockabilly hall of fame , an online site recognizing the development of rockabilly in which tennessee played a crucial role , is based in nashville .
tennessee 's major industries include agriculture , manufacturing , and tourism .
poultry , soybeans , and cattle are the state 's primary agricultural products , and major manufacturing exports include chemicals , transportation equipment , and electrical equipment .
the great smoky mountains national park , the nation 's most visited national park , is headquartered in the eastern part of the state , and a section of the appalachian trail roughly follows the tennessee-north carolina border .
other major tourist attractions include the tennessee aquarium in chattanooga , the sunsphere in knoxville , dollywood in pigeon forge , the parthenon , the country music hall of fame and museum , and ryman auditorium in nashville , and
the headquarters of major league baseball at 245 park avenue , midtown manhattan , new york city , usa .

delaware is a u.s. state located on the atlantic coast in the mid-atlantic region of the united states .
it is bordered to the south and west by maryland , to the northeast by new jersey , and to the north by pennsylvania .
the state takes its name from thomas west , 3rd baron de la warr , an english nobleman and virginia 's first colonial governor , after whom what is now called cape henlopen was originally named .
delaware is located in the northeastern portion of the delmarva peninsula and is the second smallest , the sixth least populous , but the sixth most densely populated of the fifty united states .
delaware is divided into three counties .
from north to south , these three counties are new castle , kent , and sussex .
while the southern two counties have historically been predominantly agricultural , new castle county has been more industrialized .
before its coastline was explored by europeans in the 16th century , delaware was inhabited by several groups of native americans , including the lenape in the north and nanticoke in the south .
it was initially colonized by dutch traders at zwaanendael , located near the present town of lewes , in 1631 .
delaware was one of the 13 colonies participating in the american revolution and on december 7 , 1787 , became the first state to ratify the constitution of the united states , thereby becoming known as the first state .
this is the complete list of the ratified and unratified amendments to the united states constitution which received the approval of the united states congress .
twenty-seven amendments have been ratified since the original signing of the constitution , the first ten of which are known collectively as the bill of rights .
the procedure for amending the united states constitution is governed by article v of the original text .
there have been many other proposals for amendments to the united states constitution introduced in congress , but not submitted to the states .
before an amendment can take effect , it must be proposed to the states by a two-thirds vote of both houses of congress or by a convention known as an article v convention called by two-thirds of the
to date , no convention for proposing amendments has been called by the states , and only once ??? in 1933 for the ratification of the twenty-first amendment ??? has the convention method of ratification been employed .

thunder is the sound caused by lightning .
depending on the nature of the lightning and distance of the listener , thunder can range from a sharp , loud crack to a long , low rumble brontide .
the sudden increase in pressure and temperature from lightning produces rapid expansion of the air surrounding and within a bolt of lightning .
in turn , this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave , similar to a sonic boom , which produces the sound of thunder , often referred to as a clap , crack , or peal of thunder .
the distance of the lightning can be calculated by the listener based on the time interval from when the lightning is seen to when the sound is heard .
martin luther king , jr. . day is a united states federal holiday marking the birthday of rev. dr. martin luther king , jr. .
it is observed on the third monday of january each year , which is around the time of king 's birthday , january 15 .
the floating holiday is similar to holidays set under the uniform monday holiday act , though the act predated the establishment of martin luther king , jr. . day by 15 years .
king was the chief spokesman for nonviolent activism in the civil rights movement , which successfully protested racial discrimination in federal and state law .
the campaign for a federal holiday in king 's honor began soon after his assassination in 1968 .
ronald reagan signed the holiday into law in 1983 , and it was first observed on january 20 , 1986 .
at first , some states resisted observing the holiday as such , giving it alternative names or combining it with other holidays .
it was officially observed in all 50 states for the first time in 2000 .

the raccoon , procyon lotor , sometimes spelled racoon , also known as the common raccoon , north american raccoon , northern raccoon and colloquially as coon , is a medium-sized mammal native to north america .
the raccoon is the largest of the procyonid family , having a body length of and a body weight of .
its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur which insulates against cold weather .
two of the raccoon 's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws and its facial mask , which are themes in the mythology of several native american tribes .
raccoons are noted for their intelligence , with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for up to three years .
the diet of the omnivorous raccoon , which is usually nocturnal , consists of about 40 % invertebrates , 33 % plant foods , and 27 % vertebrates .
the original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests , but due to their adaptability they have extended their range to mountainous areas , coastal marshes , and urban areas , where some homeowners consider them to be
as a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century , raccoons are now also distributed across the european mainland , the caucasus region and japan .
though previously thought to be solitary , there is now evidence that raccoons engage in gender-specific social behavior .
related females often share a common area , while unrelated males live together in groups of up to four animals to maintain their positions against foreign males during the mating season , and other potential invaders .
home range sizes vary anywhere from 3 hectares 7 acres for females in cities to 50 km2 20 sq mi for males in prairies .
after a gestation period of about 65 days , two to five young , known as `` kits '' , are born in spring .
the kits are subsequently raised by their mother until dispersion in late fall .
although captive raccoons have been known to live over 20 years , their average life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1 years .
in many areas , hunting and vehicular injury are the two most common causes of death .
the 2010 haiti earthquake was a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 mw earthquake , with an epicenter near the town of l ?? og ?? ne ouest department , approximately west of port-au-prince , haiti 's capital .
the earthquake occurred at 16:53 local time 21:53 utc on tuesday , 12 january 2010 .
by 24 january , at least 52 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater had been recorded .
an estimated three million people were affected by the quake .
the highest reliable death count was estimated at 220,000 .
haitian government estimates were higher .
the government of haiti estimated that 250,000 residences and 30,000 commercial buildings had collapsed or were severely damaged .
the earthquake caused major damage in port-au-prince , jacmel and other settlements in the region .
many notable landmark buildings were significantly damaged or destroyed , including the presidential palace , the national assembly building , the port-au-prince cathedral , and the main jail .
among those killed were archbishop of port-au-prince joseph serge miot , and opposition leader micha gaillard .
the headquarters of the united nations stabilization mission in haiti minustah , located in the capital , collapsed , killing many , including the mission 's chief , h ?? di annabi .
many countries responded to appeals for humanitarian aid , pledging funds and dispatching rescue and medical teams , engineers and support personnel .
communication systems , air , land , and sea transport facilities , hospitals , and electrical networks had been damaged by the earthquake , which hampered rescue and aid efforts ; confusion over who was in charge , air traffic
port-au-prince 's morgues were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of bodies .
these had to be buried in mass graves .
as rescues tailed off , supplies , medical care and sanitation became priorities .
delays in aid distribution led to angry appeals from aid workers and survivors , and looting and sporadic violence were observed .
on 22 january the united nations noted that the emergency phase of the relief operation was drawing to a close , and on the following day the haitian government officially called off the search for survivors .
mister ed is a fictional talking horse , originally appearing in short stories by walter r. brooks , and later in an american television situation comedy produced by filmways that first aired in syndication from january 5 to july 2
the stars of the show were mister ed , a palomino horse who could `` talk '' , played by gelding bamboo harvester and voiced by former western star allan lane who went uncredited for the entire length of
much of the program 's humor stemmed from the fact mister ed would speak only to wilbur , as well as ed 's notoriety as a troublemaker .
other running jokes centered on wilbur 's character being a huge klutz and inadvertently causing harm to himself or others .
according to the show 's producer , arthur lubin , young was chosen as the lead character because he `` just seemed like the sort of guy a horse would talk to '' .
lubin , a friend of mae west , scored a coup by persuading the screen icon to guest star in one episode .
in the united states , reruns aired on nick at nite from march 3 , 1986 , to february 1 , 1993 .
sister station tv land also reran the show from 1996 ??? 98 and again from 2003-06 .

the rapture is a term in christian eschatology which refers to the `` being caught up '' discussed in 1 thessalonians 4:17 , when the `` dead in christ '' and `` we who are alive and remain '' will
the term `` rapture '' is used in at least two senses .
in the pre-tribulation view , a group of people will be left behind on earth after another group literally leaves `` to meet the lord in the air . ''
this is now the most common use of the term , especially among fundamentalist christians and in the united states .
the other , older use of the term `` rapture '' is simply as a synonym for the final resurrection generally , without a belief that a group of people is left behind on earth for an extended tribulation period
this distinction is important as some types of christianity never refer to `` the rapture '' in religious education , but might use the older and more general sense of the word `` rapture '' in referring to what happens
there are many views among christians regarding the timing of christ 's return including whether it will occur in one event or two , and various views regarding the destination of the aerial gathering described in 1 thessalonians
denominations such as roman catholics , orthodox christians , lutheran christians , and reformed christians believe in a rapture only in the sense of a general final resurrection , when christ returns a single time .
they do not believe that a group of people is left behind on earth for an extended tribulation period after the events of 1 thessalonians 4:17 .
pre-tribulation rapture theology was developed in the 1830s by john nelson darby and the plymouth brethren , and popularized in the united states in the early 20th century by the wide circulation of the scofield reference bible .

in financial accounting , a balance sheet or statement of financial position is a summary of the financial balances of a sole proprietorship , a business partnership , a corporation or other business organization , such as an llc or
assets , liabilities and ownership equity are listed as of a specific date , such as the end of its financial year .
a balance sheet is often described as a `` snapshot of a company 's financial condition '' .
of the four basic financial statements , the balance sheet is the only statement which applies to a single point in time of a business ' calendar year .
a standard company balance sheet has three parts : assets , liabilities and ownership equity .
the main categories of assets are usually listed first , and typically in order of liquidity .
assets are followed by the liabilities .
the difference between the assets and the liabilities is known as equity or the net assets or the net worth or capital of the company and according to the accounting equation , net worth must equal assets minus liabilities .
another way to look at the same equation is that assets equals liabilities plus owner 's equity .
looking at the equation in this way shows how assets were financed : either by borrowing money liability or by using the owner 's money owner 's equity .
balance sheets are usually presented with assets in one section and liabilities and net worth in the other section with the two sections `` balancing . ''
a business operating entirely in cash can measure its profits by withdrawing the entire bank balance at the end of the period , plus any cash in hand .
however , many businesses are not paid immediately ; they build up inventories of goods and they acquire buildings and equipment .
in other words : businesses have assets and so they can not , even if they want to , immediately turn these into cash at the end of each period .
often , these businesses owe money to suppliers and to tax authorities , and the proprietors do not withdraw all their original capital and profits at the end of each period .
in other words businesses also have liabilities .

the american civil war acw , also known as the war between the states or simply the civil war see naming , was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the united states
the war had its origin in the issue of slavery , especially the extension of slavery into the western territories .
foreign powers did not intervene .
after four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the south 's infrastructure , the confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished , and the difficult reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing
in the 1860 presidential election , republicans , led by abraham lincoln , opposed expanding slavery into united states ' territories .
lincoln won , but before his inauguration on march 4 , 1861 , seven cotton-based slave states formed the confederacy .
outgoing democratic president james buchanan and the incoming republicans rejected secession as illegal .
lincoln 's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war .
eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession .
confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the confederacy .
a peace conference failed to find a compromise , and both sides prepared for war .
the confederates assumed that european countries were so dependent on '' king cotton '' that they would intervene ; none did and none recognized the new confederate states of america .
hostilities began on april 12 , 1861 , when confederate forces fired upon fort sumter , a key fort held by union troops in south carolina .
lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort ; consequently , four more slave states joined the confederacy , bringing their total to eleven .
the union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy .
the eastern theater was inconclusive in 1861 ??? 62 .
the autumn 1862 confederate campaign into maryland a union state ended with confederate retreat at the battle of antietam , dissuading british intervention .
lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal .
to the west , by summer 1862 the union destroyed the confederate river navy , then much of their western armies , and the union at vicksburg split the confederacy in two at the mississippi river .
in 1863 , robert e. lee 's confederate incursion north ended at the battle of gettysburg .
western successes led to ulysses s. grant command of all union armies in 1864 .
in the western theater , william t. sherman drove east to capture atlanta and marched to the sea , destroying confederate infrastructure along the way .
the union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the confederacy from all directions , and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the overland campaign towards richmond , the confederate capital .
the defending confederate army failed , leading to lee 's surrender to grant at appomattox court house on april 9 , 1865 .
the american civil war was one of the earliest true industrial wars .
railroads , the telegraph , steamships , and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively .
the mobilization of civilian factories , mines , shipyards , banks , transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed world war i .
it remains the deadliest war in american history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties .
historian john huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all northern males 20 ??? 45 years old , and 30 percent of all southern white males aged 18 ??? 40 .

stereo 8 , commonly known as the eight-track cartridge , eight-track tape , or simply eight-track , is a magnetic tape sound recording technology .
it was popular in the united states from the mid-1960s through to the early 1980s , but was relatively unknown in many european countries .

gaius julius caesar , july 100 bc ??? 15 march 44 bc was a roman general , statesman , consul and notable author of latin prose .
he played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the roman republic and the rise of the roman empire .
in 60 bc , caesar , crassus and pompey formed a political alliance that was to dominate roman politics for several years .
their attempts to amass power through populist tactics were opposed by the conservative elite within the roman senate , among them cato the younger with the frequent support of cicero .
caesar 's conquest of gaul , completed by 51 bc , extended rome 's territory to the english channel and the rhine .
caesar became the first roman general to cross both when he built a bridge across the rhine and conducted the first invasion of britain .
these achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of pompey , who had realigned himself with the senate after the death of crassus in 53 bc .
with the gallic wars concluded , the senate ordered caesar to lay down his military command and return to rome .
caesar refused , and marked his defiance in 49 bc by crossing the rubicon with a legion , leaving his province and illegally entering roman territory under arms .
civil war resulted , from which he emerged as the unrivaled leader of rome .
after assuming control of government , caesar began a program of social and governmental reforms , including the creation of the julian calendar .
he centralised the bureaucracy of the republic and was eventually proclaimed `` dictator in perpetuity '' .
but the underlying political conflicts had not been resolved , and on the ides of march 15 march 44 bc , caesar was assassinated by a group of senators led by marcus junius brutus .
a new series of civil wars broke out , and the constitutional government of the republic was never restored .
caesar 's adopted heir octavian , later known as augustus , rose to sole power , and the era of the roman empire began .
much of caesar 's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns , and from other contemporary sources , mainly the letters and speeches of cicero and the historical writings of sallust .
the later biographies of caesar by suetonius and plutarch are also major sources .
caesar is deemed to be one of the greatest military commanders of history .
linguistic map of nigeria , cameroon , and benin .
sign in english , outside the university of lagos
there are hundreds of languages spoken in nigeria .
the major languages are yoruba , hausa , igbo , edo , fulfulde , kanuri , and ibibio .
the official language of nigeria , english , the former colonial language , was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country .
english , however , remains an exclusive preserve of the country 's urban elite , and is not widely spoken in rural areas , which comprise three quarters of the countries population .
nigeria 's linguistic diversity is a microcosm of africa as a whole , encompassing three major african languages families : afroasiatic , nilo-saharan , and niger ??? congo .
nigeria also has several as-yet unclassified languages , such as cen tuum , which may represent a relic of an even greater diversity prior to the spread of the current language families .

a use tax in united states is complementary to sales tax which means , if you buy a taxable product\/services without paying any sales tax to vendor , you owe use tax .
you must self assess use tax and pay it directly to the state where the products were consumed or services were rendered .
use tax typically is a tax on consumption but if you buy an item without paying sales tax and store it in your warehouse initially , use tax applies to that location where goods were stored .
later on when the final consumption takes place at some other location , you are required to pay the differential of tax rate to the jurisdiction of ultimate place of consumption .
this really means that you do n't have to pay both sales tax as well as use tax on one transaction .
it is only one or the other that you are required to pay on purchase of taxable products\/services .
if vendor does n't charge any sales tax on its invoice then it is the obligation of the buyer to self assess use tax and pay it to the appropriate jurisdication .
use tax is generally charged at the same tax rate of sales tax but in some states the tax rate is different .
use tax is also termed as `` consumption tax '' or `` consumer use tax '' .
a use tax is a type of excise tax levied in the united states by numerous state governments .
it is assessed upon tangible personal property purchased by a resident of the assessing state for use , storage , or consumption in that state not for resale , regardless of where the purchase took place .
if a resident of a state makes a purchase within his home state , full sales tax is paid at the time of the transaction .
the use tax applies when a resident of the assessing state purchases an item that is not subject to his home state 's sales tax .
usually , this is due to out-of-state purchases , as well as ordering items through the mail , by phone , or over the internet from other states .
the use tax is typically assessed at the same rate as the sales tax that would have been owed if any had the same goods been purchased in the state of residence .
for example , a resident of massachusetts , with a 6.25 % `` sales and use tax '' on certain goods and services , purchases non-exempt goods or services in new hampshire for use , storage or other consumption in
under new hampshire law , the new hampshire vendor collects no sales taxes on the goods , but the massachusetts purchaser\/user must still pay 6.25 % of the sales price directly to the department of revenue in massachusetts as a
if the same goods are purchased in a us state that does collect sales tax for such goods at time of purchase , whatever taxes were paid by the purchaser to that state can be deducted as a tax
with few exceptions , no state 's vendors will charge the native state 's sales tax on goods shipped out of state , meaning all goods ordered from out-of-state are essentially free of sales tax .
the purchaser is therefore required to declare and pay the use tax to his home state on these ordered goods .
the assessing jurisdiction may make the use tax payable annually , but some states require a monthly payment .
for example , where a vermont resident has not paid at least 6 % sales tax on property brought in for use in the state , vermont law requires filing a tax return form su-452 and payment by
typical exemptions include purchases by charitable non-profit organizations or governmental agencies , purchases for resale in commerce , and purchases via `` casual sales '' by individuals not in the ordinary course of business .
also note that there are thousands of tax jurisdictions in the u.s. and many have ever-changing lists of specific types of goods and services that are not taxable .
as an illustration of the complexities : a 2006 massachusetts law requires payment of tax on `` pre-written '' not custom software purchased and downloaded over the internet for installation and use in massachusetts , regardless of where
however , the actual use of the same software downloaded by a massachusetts resident to a server in another state remains a non-taxed `` service '' .
in contrast , arkansas generally does not tax anything delivered over the internet such as downloaded software or music , except voip which is specifically defined as taxable `` telecommunications services '' .
software pre-written or custom `` delivered thru a tangible medium '' i.e. , on disk in arkansas is taxable even if ordered online , except `` custom software for a particular customer '' which is non-taxable
in most cases , this complexity is part of the underlying sales tax laws ; but while a brick-and-mortar store has to deal with only the sales tax laws of its own location , remote sellers have to deal with
in medicine , pulmonary hypertension ph is an increase of blood pressure in the pulmonary artery , pulmonary vein , or pulmonary capillaries , together known as the lung vasculature , leading to shortness of breath , dizziness
pulmonary hypertension can be a severe disease with a markedly decreased exercise tolerance and heart failure .
it was first identified by dr. ernst von romberg in 1891 .
according to the most recent classification , it can be one of five different types : arterial , venous , hypoxic , thromboembolic or miscellaneous .
in computer science , array programming languages also known as vector or multidimensional languages generalize operations on scalars to apply transparently to vectors , matrices , and higher dimensional arrays .
array programming primitives concisely express broad ideas about data manipulation .
the level of conciseness can be dramatic in certain cases : it is not uncommon to find array programming language one-liners that require more than a couple of pages of java code .
apl , designed by ken iverson , was the first programming language to provide array programming capabilities .
the mnemonic apl refers to the title of his seminal book `` a programming language '' and not to arrays per se . iverson 's contribution to rigor and clarity was probably more important than the simple extension of dimensions
photograph of the berlin wall taken from the west side .
the wall was built in 1961 to prevent east germans from fleeing from communism .
it was an iconic symbol of the cold war and its fall in 1989 marked the end of the war .
the cold war , often dated from 1947 to 1991 , was a sustained state of political and military tension between powers in the western bloc , dominated by the united states with nato among its allies , and powers
this began after the success of their temporary wartime alliance against nazi germany , leaving the ussr and the us as two superpowers with profound economic and political differences .
a neutral faction arose with the non-aligned movement founded by egypt , india , and yugoslavia ; this faction rejected association with either the us-led west or the soviet-led east .
the cold war was so named because the two major powers ??? each possessing nuclear weapons and thereby threatened with mutual assured destruction ??? never met in direct military combat .
instead , in their struggle for global influence they engaged in ongoing psychological warfare and in regular indirect confrontations through proxy wars .
cycles of relative calm would be followed by high tension , which could have led to world war .
the tensest times were during the berlin blockade 1948 ??? 1949 , the korean war 1950 ??? 1953 , the suez crisis 1956 , the berlin crisis of 1961 , the cuban missile crisis
the conflict was expressed through military coalitions , strategic conventional force deployments , extensive aid to client states , espionage , massive propaganda campaigns , conventional and nuclear arms races , appeals to neutral nations , rivalry at sports events
the us and ussr became involved in political and military conflicts in the third world countries of latin america , africa , the middle east , and southeast asia .
to alleviate the risk of a potential nuclear war , both sides sought relief of political tensions through d ?? tente in the 1970s .
in the 1980s , the united states increased diplomatic , military , and economic pressures on the soviet union , at a time when the communist state was already suffering from economic stagnation .
in the mid-1980s , the new soviet president mikhail gorbachev introduced the liberalizing reforms of perestroika `` reorganization '' , 1987 and glasnost `` openness '' , ca . 1985 .
pressures for national independence grew stronger in eastern europe , especially poland .
they reached a breaking point when gorbachev refused to use soviet troops to support the faltering government of east germany in late 1989 .
within weeks all the satellite states broke free from moscow in a peaceful wave of revolutions there was some violence in romania .
the pressures escalated inside the soviet union , where communism fell and the ussr was formally dissolved in late 1991 .
the united states remained as the world 's only superpower .
the cold war and its events have left a significant legacy , and it is often referred to in popular culture , especially in media featuring themes of espionage and the threat of nuclear warfare .

sulfonamide functional group
hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide and a thiazide .
furosemide is a sulfonamide , but not a thiazide .
sulfonamide or sulphonamide is the basis of several groups of drugs .
the original antibacterial sulfonamides sometimes called sulfa drugs or sulpha drugs are synthetic antimicrobial agents that contain the sulfonamide group .
some sulfonamides are also devoid of antibacterial activity , e.g. , the anticonvulsant sultiame .
the sulfonylureas and thiazide diuretics are newer drug groups based on the antibacterial sulfonamides .
sulfa allergies are common , hence medications containing sulfonamides are prescribed carefully .
it is important to make a distinction between sulfa drugs and other sulfur-containing drugs and additives , such as sulfates and sulfites , which are chemically unrelated to the sulfonamide group , and do not cause the same hypersensitivity reactions

new york city cruise liner terminal in hell 's kitchen at 52nd street .
the new york passenger ship terminal also known as the luxury liner row or manhattan cruise terminal or new york cruise terminal is a terminal for ocean-going passenger ships on manhattan 's west side .
the terminal consists of north river piers 88 , 90 , 92 and 94 on the hudson river between west 46th and west 54th street .
-lrb- as a general rule , pier numbers in manhattan can be determined by adding 40 to the corresponding cross-street .
ships now dock at piers 88 , 90 and 92 .
pier 94 on the north side is now used for exhibition space .
pier 86 , once used by united states lines , is now home to the uss intrepid .
in 2003 , the terminal handled 900,000 passengers .
the city is forecasting that 1.5 million will use the terminal by 2017 .
the piers are long and apart .
they were first completed in 1935 to replace the chelsea piers as the city 's luxury liner terminal .
the new terminal was built to handle bigger ships that had outgrown the chelsea piers .
the piers were renovated in 1970 and are currently undergoing another $ 150 million renovation .
the renovated plans call for it to handle three large ships at a time .
in doing renovations , the city is also considering decommissioning pier 92 .
logo of the new york cruise terminal . for
decades the terminal was the only ocean-going passenger terminal in new york harbor .
with an upsurge in cruise ship traffic and the terminal 's ability to handle comfortably only three large ships at a time , two new terminals have opened in the harbor ??? the cape liberty cruise port opened in 2004
the west side highway takes a small jog east from the piers to below west 42nd street because when the terminal was built land had to be taken away from manhattan to allow for longer piers .
the us army corps of engineers , who control the waterfront dimension , would not extend the pierhead line farther into the river , so the city extended the pier by cutting away at the land .
the city earlier did this for the chelsea piers ; however in chelsea only landfill was taken away .
at the passenger terminal actual manhattan schist was taken away .
from downstream in the river
many major passenger ships have docked there , including the rms queen mary 2 and freedom of the seas , before the brooklyn and bayonne terminals opened .

christian right is a term used in the united states to describe right-wing christian political groups that are characterized by their strong support of socially conservative policies .
christian conservatives principally seek to apply their understanding of the teachings of christianity to politics and public policy by proclaiming the value of those teachings and\/or by seeking to use those teachings to influence law and public policy .
in the u.s. , the christian right is an informal coalition formed around a core of evangelical protestants that draws `` support from politically conservative catholics , jews , mormons , and occasionally secularists '' who share their goals .
the movement has its roots in american politics going back as far the 1940s and has been especially influential since the 1970s .
their influence draws , in part , from grassroots activism as well as their focus on social issues and ability to motivate the electorate around those issues .
the christian right is notable today for advancing socially conservative positions on issues including school prayer , stem cell research , homosexuality , contraception , abortion , and pornography .
although the christian right is usually associated with the u.s. , the movement has been a key factor in the politics of canada , the netherlands , northern ireland and australia , among others .

hurricane katrina was the deadliest and most destructive atlantic hurricane of the 2005 atlantic hurricane season .
it was the costliest natural disaster , as well as one of the five deadliest hurricanes , in the history of the united states .
among recorded atlantic hurricanes , it was the sixth strongest overall .
at least 1,833 people died in the hurricane and subsequent floods , making it the deadliest u.s. hurricane since the 1928 okeechobee hurricane ; total property damage was estimated at $ 81 billion 2005 usd , nearly triple
hurricane katrina formed over the bahamas on august 23 , 2005 and crossed southern florida as a moderate category 1 hurricane , causing some deaths and flooding there before strengthening rapidly in the gulf of mexico .
the hurricane strengthened to a category 5 hurricane over the warm gulf water , but weakened before making its second landfall as a category 3 hurricane on the morning of monday , august 29 in southeast louisiana .
it caused severe destruction along the gulf coast from central florida to texas , much of it due to the storm surge .
the most significant number of deaths occurred in new orleans , louisiana , which flooded as the levee system catastrophically failed , in many cases hours after the storm had moved inland .
eventually 80 % of the city and large tracts of neighboring parishes became flooded , and the floodwaters lingered for weeks .
however , the worst property damage occurred in coastal areas , such as all mississippi beachfront towns , which were flooded over 90 % in hours , as boats and casino barges rammed buildings , pushing cars and houses inland
the hurricane surge protection failures in new orleans are considered the worst civil engineering disaster in u.s. history and prompted a lawsuit against the u.s. army corps of engineers usace , the designers and builders of the levee
responsibility for the failures and flooding was laid squarely on the army corps in january 2008 by judge stanwood duval , u.s. district court , but the federal agency could not be held financially liable due to sovereign immunity in
there was also an investigation of the responses from federal , state and local governments , resulting in the resignation of federal emergency management agency fema director michael d. brown , and of new orleans police department
several agencies including the united states coast guard uscg , national hurricane center nhc , and national weather service nws were commended for their actions .
they provided accurate hurricane weather tracking forecasts with sufficient lead time .
even the most insistent appeals from national , state and local public officials to residents to evacuate before the storm did not warn that the levees could breach and fail .
in basketball , an assist is attributed to a player who passes the ball to a teammate in a way that leads to a score by field goal , meaning that he or she was `` assisting '' in the
there is some judgment involved in deciding whether a passer should be credited with an assist .
an assist can be scored for the passer even if the player who receives the pass makes a basket after dribbling the ball .
however , the original definition of an assist did not include such situations , so the comparison of assist statistics across eras is a complex matter .
only the pass directly before the score may be counted as an assist , so no more than one assist can be recorded per field goal unlike in other sports , such as ice hockey .
a pass that leads to a shooting foul and scoring by free throws does not count as an assist in the nba , but does in fiba play only one assist is awarded per set of free throws in
point guards tend to get the most assists per game apg , as their role is primarily that of a passer and ballhandler .
centers tend to get fewer assists , but centers with good floor presence and court vision can dominate a team by assisting .
being inside the key , the center often has the best angles and the best position for `` dishes '' and other short passes in the scoring area .
center wilt chamberlain led the nba in assists in 1968 .
a strong center with inside-scoring prowess , such as former nba center hakeem olajuwon , can also be an effective assistor because the defense 's double-teaming tends to open up offense in the form of shooters .
the nba single-game assist record is 30 , held by scott skiles of the orlando magic against the denver nuggets , on december 30 , 1990 .
the nba record for most career assists is held by john stockton with 15,806 .
the mill or mille sometimes mil in the uk , when discussing property taxes in the united states , or previously in cyprus and malta is a now-abstract unit of currency used sometimes in accounting .
in the united states , it is a notional unit equivalent to of a united states dollar a tenth of a cent .
in the united kingdom it was proposed during the decades of discussion on the decimalization of the pound as a division of the pound sterling .
several other currencies used the mill , such as the maltese lira .
the term comes from the latin `` millesimum '' , meaning `` thousandth part '' .
the greco-persian wars also often called the persian wars were a series of conflicts between the achaemenid empire of persia and city-states of the hellenic world that started in 499 bc and lasted until 449 bc .
the collision between the fractious political world of the greeks and the enormous empire of the persians began when cyrus the great conquered ionia in 547 bc .
struggling to rule the independent-minded cities of ionia , the persians appointed tyrants to rule each of them .
this would prove to be the source of much trouble for the greeks and persians alike .
in 499 bc , the then tyrant of miletus , aristagoras , embarked on an expedition to conquer the island of naxos , with persian support ; however , the expedition was a debacle and , pre-empting his dismissal ,
this was the beginning of the ionian revolt , which would last until 493 bc , progressively drawing more regions of asia minor into the conflict .
aristagoras secured military support from athens and eretria , and in 498 bc these forces helped to capture and burn the persian regional capital of sardis .
the persian king darius the great vowed to have revenge on athens and eretria for this act .
the revolt continued , with the two sides effectively stalemated throughout 497 ??? 495 bc .
in 494 bc , the persians regrouped , and attacked the epicentre of the revolt in miletus .
at the battle of lade , the ionians suffered a decisive defeat , and the rebellion collapsed , with the final members being stamped out the following year .
seeking to secure his empire from further revolts and from the interference of the mainland greeks , darius embarked on a scheme to conquer greece and to punish athens and eretria for burning sardis .
the first persian invasion of greece began in 492 bc , with the persian general mardonius conquering thrace and macedon before several mishaps forced an early end to the campaign .
in 490 bc a second force was sent to greece , this time across the aegean sea , under the command of datis and artaphernes .
this expedition subjugated the cyclades , before besieging , capturing and razing eretria .
however , while en route to attack athens , the persian force was decisively defeated by the athenians at the battle of marathon , ending persian efforts for the time being .
darius then began to plan to complete the conquest of greece , but died in 486 bc and responsibility for the conquest passed to his son xerxes i .
in 480 bc , xerxes personally led the second persian invasion of greece with one of the largest ancient armies ever assembled .
victory over the ` allied ' greek states led by sparta and athens at the battle of thermopylae allowed the persians to torch athens and overrun most of greece .
however , while seeking to destroy the combined greek fleet , the persians suffered a severe defeat at the battle of salamis .
the following year , the confederated greeks went on the offensive , defeating the persian army at the battle of plataea , and ending the invasion of greece .
the allied greeks followed up their success by destroying the rest of the persian fleet at the battle of mycale , before expelling persian garrisons from sestos 479 bc and byzantium 478 bc .
the actions of the general pausanias at the siege of byzantium alienated many of the greek states from the spartans , and the anti-persian alliance was therefore reconstituted around athenian leadership , as the so-called delian league .
the delian league continued to campaign against persia for the next three decades , beginning with the expulsion of the remaining persian garrisons from europe .
at the battle of the eurymedon in 466 bc , the league won a double victory that finally secured freedom for the cities of ionia .
however , the league 's involvement in an egyptian revolt from 460 ??? 454 bc resulted in a disastrous defeat , and further campaigning was suspended .
a fleet was sent to cyprus in 451 bc , but achieved little , and when it withdrew the greco-persian wars drew to a quiet end .
some historical sources suggest the end of hostilities was marked by a peace treaty between athens and persia , the so-called peace of callias .
a schematic presentation of the plum pudding model of the atom ; in thomson 's mathematical model the `` corpuscles '' or modern electrons were arranged non-randomly , in rotating rings
the current model of the sub-atomic structure involves a dense nucleus surrounded by a probabilistic `` cloud '' of electrons
the plum pudding model of the atom by j. j. thomson , who discovered the electron in 1897 , was proposed in 1904 before the discovery of the atomic nucleus in order to add the electron to the atomic model
in this model , the atom is composed of electrons which thomson still called `` corpuscles '' , though g. j. stoney had proposed that atoms of electricity be called electrons in 1894 surrounded by a soup of
the electrons as we know them today were thought to be positioned throughout the atom , but with many structures possible for positioning multiple electrons , particularly rotating rings of electrons see below .
instead of a soup , the atom was also sometimes said to have had a `` cloud '' of positive charge .
with this model , thomson abandoned his earlier `` nebular atom '' hypothesis in which the atom was composed of immaterial vortices .
now , at least part of the atom was to be composed of thomson 's particulate negative corpuscles , although the rest of the positively charged part of the atom remained somewhat nebulous and ill-defined .
the 1904 thomson model was disproved by the 1909 gold foil experiment of hans geiger and ernest marsden .
this was interpreted by ernest rutherford in 1911
to imply a very small nucleus of the atom containing a very high positive charge in the case of gold , enough to balance about 100 electrons , thus leading to the rutherford model of the atom .
although gold has an atomic number of 79 , immediately after rutherford 's paper appeared in 1911 antonius van den broek made the intuitive suggestion that atomic number is nuclear charge .
the matter required experiment to decide .
henry moseley 's work showed experimentally in 1913 see moseley 's law that the effective nuclear charge was very close to the atomic number moseley found only one unit difference , and moseley referenced only the
this work culminated in the solar-system-like but quantum-limited bohr model of the atom in the same year , in which a nucleus containing an atomic number of positive charge is surrounded by an equal number of electrons in
bohr had also inspired moseley 's work .
thomson 's model was compared though not by thomson to a british dessert called plum pudding , hence the name .
thomson 's paper was published in the march 1904 edition of the philosophical magazine , the leading british science journal of the day .
in thomson 's view : ... the atoms of the elements consist of a number of negatively electrified corpuscles enclosed in a sphere of uniform positive electrification , ...
in this model , the electrons were free to rotate within the blob or cloud of positive substance .
these orbits were stabilized in the model by the fact that when an electron moved farther from the center of the positive cloud , it felt a larger net positive inward force , because there was more material of opposite
in thomson 's model , electrons were free to rotate in rings which were further stabilized by interactions between the electrons , and spectra were to be accounted for by energy differences of different ring orbits .
thomson attempted to make his model account for some of the major spectral lines known for some elements , but was not notably successful at this .
still , thomson 's model along with a similar saturnian ring model for atomic electrons , also put forward in 1904 by nagaoka after james clerk maxwell 's model of saturn 's rings , were earlier harbingers of
typical strip of bacon .
bacon is a cured meat prepared from a pig .
it is first cured using large quantities of salt , either in a brine or in a dry packing ; the result is fresh bacon also known as green bacon .
fresh bacon may then be further dried for weeks or months in cold air , or it may be boiled or smoked .
fresh and dried bacon is typically cooked before eating .
boiled bacon is ready to eat , as is some smoked bacon , but may be cooked further before eating .
bacon is prepared from several different cuts of meat .
it is usually made from side and back cuts of pork , except in the united states , where it is almost always prepared from pork belly typically referred to as `` streaky '' , `` fatty '' ,
the side cut has more meat and less fat than the belly .
bacon may be prepared from either of two distinct back cuts : fatback , which is almost pure fat , and pork loin , which is very lean .
bacon-cured pork loin is known as back bacon .
uncooked pork belly bacon strips .
bacon may be eaten smoked , boiled , fried , baked , or grilled , or used as a minor ingredient to flavor dishes .
bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts , especially game , e.g. venison , pheasant .
the word is derived from the old high german bacho , meaning `` buttock '' , `` ham '' or `` side of bacon '' , and cognate with the old french bacon .
in continental europe , this part of the pig is usually not smoked like bacon is in the united states ; it is used primarily in cubes lardons as a cooking ingredient , valued both as a source
in italy , this is called pancetta and is usually cooked in small cubes or served uncooked and thinly sliced as part of an antipasto .
meat from other animals , such as beef , lamb , chicken , goat , or turkey , may also be cut , cured , or otherwise prepared to resemble bacon , and may even be referred to as ``
such use is common in areas with significant jewish and muslim populations .
the usda defines bacon as `` the cured belly of a swine carcass '' ; other cuts and characteristics must be separately qualified e.g. , `` smoked pork loin bacon '' .
for safety , bacon must be treated to prevent trichinosis , caused by trichinella , a parasitic roundworm which can be destroyed by heating , freezing , drying , or smoking .
bacon is distinguished from salt pork and ham by differences in the brine or dry packing .
bacon brine has added curing ingredients , most notably sodium nitrite , and occasionally sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate saltpeter ; sodium ascorbate or erythorbate are added to accelerate curing and stabilize color .
flavorings such as brown sugar or maple are used for some products .
if used , sodium polyphosphates are added to improve sliceability and reduce spattering when the bacon is pan fried .
today , a brine for ham , but not bacon , includes a large amount of sugar .
historically , `` ham '' and `` bacon '' referred to different cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically , often together in the same barrel .
the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa , codified in part at is a federal law which establishes minimum standards for pension plans in private industry and provides for extensive rules on the federal
erisa was enacted to protect the interests of employee benefit plan participants and their beneficiaries by :
requiring the disclosure of financial and other information concerning the plan to beneficiaries ;
establishing standards of conduct for plan fiduciaries ;
providing for appropriate remedies and access to the federal courts .
erisa is sometimes used to refer to the full body of laws regulating employee benefit plans , which are found mainly in the internal revenue code and erisa itself .
responsibility for the interpretation and enforcement of erisa is divided among the department of labor , the department of the treasury particularly the internal revenue service , and the pension benefit guaranty corporation .

the u.s. subprime mortgage crisis was a set of events and conditions that led to a financial crisis and subsequent recession that began in 2008 .
it was characterized by a rise in subprime mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures , and the resulting decline of securities backed by said mortgages .
several major financial institutions collapsed in september 2008 , with significant disruption in the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and the onset of a severe global recession .
there were many causes of the crisis , with commentators assigning different levels of blame to financial institutions , regulators , credit agencies , government housing policies , and consumers , among others .
a proximate cause was the rise in subprime lending .
the percentage of lower-quality subprime mortgages originated during a given year rose from the historical 8 % or lower range to approximately 20 % from 2004 to 2006 , with much higher ratios in some parts of the u.s.
a high percentage of these subprime mortgages , over 90 % in 2006 for example , were adjustable-rate mortgages .
these two changes were part of a broader trend of lowered lending standards and higher-risk mortgage products .
further , u.s. households had become increasingly indebted , with the ratio of debt to disposable personal income rising from 77 % in 1990 to 127 % at the end of 2007 , much of this increase mortgage-related .
when u.s. home prices declined steeply after peaking in mid-2006 , borrowers ' ability to refinance their loans became more difficult .
as adjustable-rate mortgages began to reset at higher interest rates causing higher monthly payments , mortgage delinquencies soared .
securities backed with mortgages , including subprime mortgages , widely held by financial firms globally , lost most of their value .
global investors also drastically reduced purchases of mortgage-backed debt and other securities as part of a decline in the capacity and willingness of the private financial system to support lending .
concerns about the soundness of u.s. credit and financial markets led to tightening credit around the world and slowing economic growth in the u.s. and europe .
the crisis had severe , long-lasting consequences for the u.s. and european economies .
the u.s. entered a deep recession , with nearly 9 million jobs lost during 2008 and 2009 , roughly 6 % of the workforce .
u.s. housing prices fell nearly 30 % on average and the u.s. stock market fell approximately 50 % by early 2009 .
as of early 2013 , the u.s. stock market had recovered to its pre-crisis peak but housing prices remained near their low point and unemployment remained elevated .
economic growth remained below pre-crisis levels .
europe also continued to struggle with its own economic crisis .
carl jung in 1910 .
myers and briggs extrapolated their mbti theory from jung 's writings in his book psychological types .
the myers-briggs type indicator mbti assessment is a psychometric questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions .
these preferences were extrapolated from the typological theories proposed by carl gustav jung and first published in his 1921 book psychological types english edition , 1923 .
jung theorized that there are four principal psychological functions by which we experience the world : sensation , intuition , feeling , and thinking .
one of these four functions is dominant most of the time .
the original developers of the personality inventory were katharine cook briggs and her daughter , isabel briggs myers ; these two , having studied extensively the work of jung , turned their interest of human behavior into a devotion of
they began creating the indicator during world war ii , believing that a knowledge of personality preferences would help women who were entering the industrial workforce for the first time to identify the sort of war-time jobs that would be
the initial questionnaire grew into the myers-briggs type indicator , which was first published in 1962 .
the mbti focuses on normal populations and emphasizes the value of naturally occurring differences .
robert kaplan and dennis saccuzzo believe `` the underlying assumption of the mbti is that we all have specific preferences in the way we construe our experiences , and these preferences underlie our interests , needs , values , and

total superannuation industry liabilities : members funds and reserves a$ millions since 1988 .
annual total superannuation industry asset growth 1996-2005 .
superannuation in australia refers to the arrangements which people make in australia to have funds available for them in retirement .
in australia , superannuation arrangements are government-supported and encouraged , and minimum provisions are compulsory for employees .
for example , employers are required to pay a proportion of an employee 's salaries and wages currently 9 % into a superannuation fund , but people are encouraged to put aside additional funds into superannuation .
the minimum obligation required by employers is set to increase to 12 % gradually stepping annually from 2013 to 2020 .
an individual can withdraw funds out of a superannuation fund when the person meets one of the conditions of release contained in schedule 1 of the superannuation industry supervision regulations 1994 .
electoral college map showing the results of the 2012 u.s. presidential election .
president barack obama d - il won the popular vote in 26 states and the district of columbia denoted in blue to capture 332 electoral votes .
former governor mitt romney r - ma won the popular vote in 24 states denoted in red to capture 206 electoral votes .
cartogram representation of the electoral college vote for the 2012 election , with each square representing one electoral vote .
the united states electoral college is the institution that officially elects the president and vice president of the united states every four years .
the president and vice president are not elected directly by the voters .
instead , they are elected by `` electors '' who are chosen by popular vote on a state-by-state basis .
electors are apportioned to each state and the district of columbia , but not to territorial possessions of the united states , such as puerto rico and guam .
the number of electors in each state is equal to the number of members of congress to which the state is entitled .
the twenty-third amendment has always resulted in the district of columbia having three electors .
there are 538 electors , based on there being 435 representatives and 100 senators , plus the three electors from the district of columbia .
electors are pledged to particular presidential and vice presidential candidates , though unpledged electors are possible .
in all states , except maine and nebraska , electors are elected on a `` winner-take-all '' basis .
that is , all electors pledged to the presidential candidate who wins the most votes in a state become electors for that state .
maine and nebraska use the `` congressional district method '' , selecting one elector within each congressional district by popular vote and selecting the remaining two electors by a statewide popular vote .
although no elector is required by federal law to honor a pledge , there have only been very few occasions when an elector voted contrary to a pledge .
the twelfth amendment specifies how a president and vice president are elected and requires each elector to cast one vote for president and another vote for vice president .
critics argue that the electoral college is inherently undemocratic and gives swing states disproportionate influence in electing the president and vice president .
the electoral college gives a numeric advantage in the election of the president to the smaller states , as the minimum number of electors for the small states is three compared to one for the election of representatives .
on the other hand , the winner-take-all method of voting favors the larger states .
a number of constitutional amendments have been proposed seeking to alter the electoral college or replace it with a direct popular vote .
barack hussein obama ii ; born august 4 , 1961 is the 44th and current president of the united states , the first african american to hold the office .
born in honolulu , hawaii , obama is a graduate of columbia university and harvard law school , where he was president of the harvard law review .
he was a community organizer in chicago before earning his law degree .
he worked as a civil rights attorney in chicago and taught constitutional law at the university of chicago law school from 1992 to 2004 .
he served three terms representing the 13th district in the illinois senate from 1997 to 2004 , running unsuccessfully for the united states house of representatives in 2000 .
in 2004 , obama received national attention during his campaign to represent illinois in the united states senate with his victory in the march democratic party primary , his keynote address at the democratic national convention in july , and
he began his presidential campaign in 2007 , and in 2008 , after a close primary campaign against hillary rodham clinton , he won sufficient delegates in the democratic party primaries to receive the presidential nomination .
he then defeated republican nominee john mccain in the general election , and was inaugurated as president on january 20 , 2009 .
nine months later , obama was named the 2009 nobel peace prize laureate .
he was re-elected president in november 2012 , defeating republican nominee mitt romney , and was sworn in for a second term on january 20 , 2013 .
early in his first term in office , obama signed into law economic stimulus legislation in response to the great recession in the form of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 and the tax relief , unemployment insurance
other major domestic initiatives in his presidency include the patient protection and affordable care act , often referred to as `` obamacare '' ; the dodd ??? frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ; the do n't ask
in may 2012 , he became the first sitting u.s. president to publicly support same-sex marriage and in 2013 his administration filed briefs which urged the supreme court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in two high-profile cases .
in foreign policy , obama ended u.s. military involvement in the iraq war , increased troop levels in afghanistan , signed the new start arms control treaty with russia , ordered u.s. military involvement in libya , and ordered the

spoilers on the front of a vehicle are often called air dams , because in addition to directing air flow they also reduce the amount of air flowing underneath the vehicle which generally reduces aerodynamic lift and drag .
spoilers are often fitted to race and high-performance sports cars , although they have become common on passenger vehicles as well .
some spoilers are added to cars primarily for styling purposes and have either little aerodynamic benefit or even make the aerodynamics worse .
spoilers for cars are often incorrectly confused with , or the term used interchangeably with , wings .
automotive wings are devices whose intended design is to generate downforce as air passes around them , not simply disrupt existing airflow patterns .

a plaque commemorating the location of the sarajevo assassination image taken in 2009
on 28 june 1914 , archduke franz ferdinand of austria , heir presumptive to the austro-hungarian throne , and his wife , sophie , duchess of hohenberg , were shot dead in sarajevo , by gavrilo princip , one of
the political objective of the assassination was to break off austria-hungary 's south-slav provinces so they could be combined into a greater serbia or a yugoslavia .
the assassins ' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as young bosnia .
serbian military officers stood behind the attack .
at the top of these serbian military conspirators was chief of serbian military intelligence dragutin dimitrijevi ?? , his righthand man major vojislav tankosi ?? , and masterspy rade malobabi ?? .
major tankosi ?? armed the assassins with bombs and pistols and trained them .
the assassins were given access to the same clandestine tunnel of safe-houses and agents that rade malobabi ?? used for the infiltration of weapons and operatives into austria-hungary .
the assassins , the key members of the clandestine tunnel , and the key serbian military conspirators who were still alive were arrested , tried , convicted and punished .
those who were arrested in bosnia were tried in sarajevo in october 1914 .
the other conspirators were arrested and tried before a serbian kangaroo court on the french-controlled salonika front in 1916 ??? 1917 on unrelated false charges ; serbia executed three of the top military conspirators .
much of what is known about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records .
assignment of responsibility for the bombing and murders of 28 june is highly controversial because the attack led to the outbreak of world war i one month later .

linguistic map of nigeria , cameroon , and benin .
sign in english , outside the university of lagos
there are hundreds of languages spoken in nigeria .
the major languages are yoruba , hausa , igbo , edo , fulfulde , kanuri , and ibibio .
the official language of nigeria , english , the former colonial language , was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country .
english , however , remains an exclusive preserve of the country 's urban elite , and is not widely spoken in rural areas , which comprise three quarters of the countries population .
nigeria 's linguistic diversity is a microcosm of africa as a whole , encompassing three major african languages families : afroasiatic , nilo-saharan , and niger ??? congo .
nigeria also has several as-yet unclassified languages , such as cen tuum , which may represent a relic of an even greater diversity prior to the spread of the current language families .
a series of events led to the attack on pearl harbor .
war between japan and the united states had been a possibility that each nation 's military forces planned for since the 1920s , though real tension did not begin until the 1931 invasion of manchuria by japan .
over the next decade , japan expanded slowly into china , leading to all out war between the two in 1937 .
in 1940 japan invaded french indochina in an effort to embargo all imports into china , including war supplies purchased from the u.s.
this move prompted the united states to embargo all oil exports , leading the imperial japanese navy to estimate that it had less than two years of bunker oil remaining and to support the existing plans to seize oil resources
planning had been underway for some time on an attack on the `` southern resource area '' to add it to the greater east asia co-prosperity sphere that japan envisioned in the pacific .
the philippine islands , at that time an american territory , were also a japanese target .
the japanese military concluded that an invasion of the philippines would provoke an american military response .
rather than seize and fortify the islands , and wait for the inevitable us counterattack , japan 's military leaders instead decided on the pre-emptive pearl harbor attack , which they assumed would negate the american forces needed for the
planning for the attack had begun in very early 1941 , by admiral isoroku yamamoto .
he finally won assent from the naval high command by , among other things , threatening to resign .
the attack was approved in the summer at an imperial conference and again at a second conference in the fall .
simultaneously over the year , pilots were trained , and ships prepared for its execution .
authority for the attack was granted at the second imperial conference if a diplomatic result satisfactory to japan was not reached .
after final approval by emperor hirohito the order to attack was issued at the beginning of december .
a multimedia message on a mobile phone .
multimedia messaging service mms is a standard way to send messages that include multimedia content to and from mobile phones .
it extends the core sms short message service capability that allowed exchange of text messages only up to 160 characters in length .
the most popular use is to send photographs from camera-equipped handsets , although it is also popular as a method of delivering news and entertainment content including videos , pictures , text pages and ringtones .
the standard is developed by the open mobile alliance oma , although during development it was part of the 3gpp and wap groups .
smallpox was an infectious disease unique to humans , caused by either of two virus variants , variola major and variola minor .
the disease is also known by the latin names variola or variola vera , derived from varius `` spotted '' or varus `` pimple '' .
the disease was originally known in english as the `` pox '' or `` red plague '' ; the term `` smallpox '' was first used in britain in the 15th century to distinguish variola from the `` great pox
the last naturally occurring case of smallpox variola minor was diagnosed on 26 october 1977 .
smallpox localized in small blood vessels of the skin and in the mouth and throat .
in the skin it resulted in a characteristic maculopapular rash and , later , raised fluid-filled blisters .
v. major produces a more serious disease and has an overall mortality rate of 30 ??? 35 % .
v. minor causes a milder form of disease also known as alastrim , cottonpox , milkpox , whitepox , and cuban itch which kills about 1 % of its victims .
long-term complications of v. major infection include characteristic scars , commonly on the face , which occur in 65 ??? 85 % of survivors .
blindness resulting from corneal ulceration and scarring , and limb deformities due to arthritis and osteomyelitis are less common complications , seen in about 2 ??? 5 % of cases .
smallpox is believed to have emerged in human populations about 10,000 bc .
the earliest physical evidence of it is probably the pustular rash on the mummified body of pharaoh ramses v of egypt .
the disease killed an estimated 400,000 europeans annually during the closing years of the 18th century including five reigning monarchs , and was responsible for a third of all blindness .
of all those infected , 20 ??? 60 % ??? and over 80 % of infected children ??? died from the disease .
smallpox was responsible for an estimated 300 ??? 500 million deaths during the 20th century .
as recently as 1967 , the world health organization who estimated that 15 million people contracted the disease and that two million died in that year .
after vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , the who certified the eradication of smallpox in 1979 .
smallpox is one of two infectious diseases to have been eradicated , the other being rinderpest , which was declared eradicated in 2011 .
`` i want to hold your hand '' is a song by the english rock band the beatles .
written by john lennon and paul mccartney , and recorded in october 1963 , it was the first beatles record to be made using four-track equipment .
with advance orders exceeding one million copies in the united kingdom , `` i want to hold your hand '' would ordinarily have gone straight to the top of the british record charts on its day of release 29
taking two weeks to dislodge its predecessor , `` i want to hold your hand '' stayed at number one for five weeks and remained in the uk top fifty for twenty-one weeks in total .
it was also the group 's first american number one , entering the billboard hot 100 chart on 18 january 1964 at number forty-five and starting the british invasion of the american music industry .
by 1 february it held the number one spot ??? for seven weeks ??? before being replaced by `` she loves you '' , a reverse scenario of what had occurred in britain , and remained in the us charts
`` i want to hold your hand '' became the beatles ' best-selling single worldwide .
a gasser was a type of hot rod originating on the dragstrips of the united states in the late 1950s and continued until the early 1970s .
gassers were based on production models from the 1930s to mid-1960s , which have been stripped of extraneous weight and jacked up using a truck beam axle to provide better weight distribution on acceleration beam axles are also lighter
common weight reduction techniques include fiberglass body panels , stripped interiors and plexiglass windows sometimes color tinted .
because they were primarily built for racing , these cars typically had the engine swapped to a larger or more powerful one , the existing stock engine modified often heavily or both .
it was very common to fit a roots supercharger and mechanical fuel injection , such as one from algon , hilborn , or crower .
with form being dictated by function , their appearance is often very top heavy and ungainly , largely due to front ends being raised higher than stock , to assist in the weight transfer during rapid acceleration racing
having their exhaust pipes exit through the front fender well is a common characteristic of gassers , as is having bodies painted in flamboyant metalflakes , pearls , and candy finishes complemented by lettering in wild fonts .
the name arose because they competed in a gasoline - fueled drag racing class , rather than one using methanol or nitromethane .
the gasser is the predecessor of the modern funny car .
`` a change is gonna come '' is a 1964 single by r&b singer-songwriter sam cooke , written and first recorded in 1963 and released under the rca victor label shortly after his death in late 1964 .
though only a modest hit for cooke in comparison with his previous singles , the song came to exemplify the 1960s ' civil rights movement .
the song has gained in popularity and critical acclaim in the decades since its release , and is # 12 on rolling stone 's 500 greatest songs of all time .
ownership of property may be private , collective , or common and the property may be objects , land\/real estate , or intellectual property .
determining ownership in law involves determining who has certain rights and duties over the property .
these rights and duties , sometimes called a ` bundle of rights ' , can be separated and held by different parties .
the question of ownership reaches back to the ancient philosophers , plato and aristotle , who held different opinions on the subject .
plato 428\/427 bc ??? 348\/347 bc thought private property created divisive inequalities , while aristotle 384 bc ??? 322 bc thought private property enabled people to receive the full benefit of their labor .
private property can circumvent what is now referred to as the ??? tragedy of the commons ??? problem , where people tend to degrade common property more than they do private property .
given a short-sighted owner , however , a private property system can make these tragedies worse ??? for example , a private owner of a piece of oil-rich property , depending on his worldview , might be more interested in
while aristotle justified the existence of private ownership , he left open questions of 1 how to allocate property between what is private and common and 2 how to allocate the private property within society .
over the millennia , and across cultures what can be property and how it is regarded culturally have varied widely .
ownership is the basis for many other concepts that form the foundations of ancient and modern societies such as money , trade , debt , bankruptcy , the criminality of theft , and private vs. public property .
ownership is the key building block in the development of the capitalist socio-economic system .
adam smith stated that one of the sacred laws of justice was to guard a person 's property and possessions .
the process and mechanics of ownership are fairly complex : one can gain , transfer and lose ownership of property in a number of ways .
to acquire property one can purchase it with money , trade it for other property , receive it as a gift , steal it , find it , make , it or homestead it .
one can transfer or lose ownership of property by selling it for money , exchanging it for other property , giving it as a gift , being robbed of it , it , or having it stripped from one 's
ownership is self-propagating in that the owner of any property will also own the economic benefits of that property .

a mathematical constant is a special number , usually a real number , that is `` significantly interesting in some way '' .
constants arise in many different areas of mathematics , with constants such as e mathematical constant | and pi | occurring in such diverse contexts as geometry , number theory and calculus .
what it means for a constant to arise `` naturally '' , and what makes a constant `` interesting '' , is ultimately a matter of taste , and some mathematical constants are notable more for historical reasons than for
the more popular constants have been studied throughout the ages and computed to many decimal places .
all mathematical constants are definable numbers and usually are also computable numbers chaitin 's constant being a significant exception .
henry louis stephens , untitled watercolor 1863 of a man reading a newspaper with headline `` presidential proclamation \/ slavery '' .
the emancipation proclamation was an order issued to all segments of the executive branch including the army and navy of the united states by president abraham lincoln on january 1 , 1863 , during the american civil war
it was based on the president 's constitutional authority as commander in chief of the armed forces ; it was not a law passed by congress .
it proclaimed all those enslaved in confederate territory to be forever free , and ordered the army and all segments of the executive branch to treat as free all those enslaved in ten states that were still in
the proclamation could not be enforced in areas still under rebellion , but as the army took control of confederate regions , the slaves in those regions were emancipated rather than returned to their masters .
from 20,000 to 50,000 former slaves in regions where rebellion had already been subdued were immediately emancipated , and over 3 million more were emancipated as the union army advanced .
the proclamation did not apply to the five slave states that were not in rebellion , nor to most regions already controlled by the union army ; emancipation there would come after separate state actions and\/or the december 1865 ratification
the proclamation did not compensate the owners , did not itself outlaw slavery , and did not make the ex-slaves called freedmen citizens .
it made the eradication of slavery an explicit war goal , in addition to the goal of reuniting the union .
on september 22 , 1862 , lincoln had issued a preliminary proclamation that he would order the emancipation of all slaves in any state of the confederate states of america that did not return to union control by january 1
none returned , and the order , signed and issued january 1 , 1863 , took effect except in locations where the union had already mostly regained control .
the proclamation outraged white southerners who envisioned a race war , angered some northern democrats , energized anti-slavery forces , and weakened forces in europe that wanted to intervene to help the confederacy .
it also lifted the spirits of african americans both in the southern and northern states , and led to many slaves escaping their masters and running behind union lines in order to have their emancipation enforced .
land rover is a british car manufacturer with its headquarters in gaydon , warwickshire , united kingdom which specialises in four-wheel-drive vehicles .
it is part of the jaguar land rover group , a subsidiary of tata motors of india .
it is the second oldest four-wheel-drive car brand in the world after jeep .
the land rover name was originally used by the rover company for one specific vehicle model , named simply the land rover , launched by rover in 1948 .
over the following years it developed into a marque encompassing a range of four-wheel-drive models , including the defender , discovery , freelander , range rover , range rover sport and range rover evoque .
land rovers are currently assembled in the company 's halewood and solihull plants , with research and development taking place at jlr 's gaydon and whitley engineering centres .
land rover sold 194,000 vehicles worldwide in 2009 .
although the brand originates from the original 1948 model , land rover as a company has only existed since 1978 .
prior to this , it was a product line of the rover company which was subsequently absorbed into the rover-triumph division of the british leyland motor corporation bl following leyland motor corporation ??? s takeover of rover in
the ongoing commercial success of the original land rover series models , and latterly the range rover in the 1970s in the midst of bl ??? s well documented business troubles prompted the establishment of a separate land rover company
in 1994 rover group plc was acquired by bmw .
in 2000 , rover group was broken-up by bmw and land rover was sold to ford motor company , becoming part of its premier automotive group .
in 2006 ford purchased the rover brand from bmw for around ?? 6 million .
this reunited the rover and land rover brands for the first time since 2000 when the rover group was broken up by bmw .
in june 2008 , ford sold both land rover and jaguar cars to tata motors .
this sale also included the dormant rover brand
the regulation of prostitution in the united states is not among the enumerated powers of the federal government ; under the tenth amendment to the united states constitution , it is therefore exclusively the domain of the states to permit
in most states , prostitution is considered a misdemeanor in the category of public order crime , a crime that disrupts the order of a community .
it was at one time considered to be a vagrancy crime .
currently , nevada is the only state to allow brothel prostitution , the terms of which are stipulated in the nevada revised statutes .
only 8 counties currently contain active brothels .
all forms of prostitution are illegal in clark county which contains the las vegas ??? paradise metropolitan area , washoe county which contains reno , carson city , douglas county , and lincoln county .

domestically , his administration generally embraced policies that transferred power from washington to the states .
among other things , he launched initiatives to fight cancer and illegal drugs , imposed wage and price controls , enforced desegregation of some southern schools , and established the environmental protection agency .
though he presided over the lunar landings beginning with apollo 11 , he scaled back manned space exploration .

sertraline hydrochloride trade names zoloft , lustral is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ssri class .
it was introduced to the market by pfizer in 1991 .
sertraline is primarily prescribed for major depressive disorder in adult outpatients as well as obsessive ??? compulsive , panic , and social anxiety disorders in both adults and children .
in 2011 , it was the second-most prescribed antidepressant on the u.s. retail market , with 37,208,000 prescriptions .
the efficacy of sertraline for depression is similar to that of older tricyclic antidepressants , but its side effects are much less pronounced .
differences with newer antidepressants are subtler and also mostly confined to side effects .
evidence suggests that sertraline may work better than fluoxetine prozac for some subtypes of depression .
treatment of panic disorder with sertraline results in a significant decrease of the number of panic attacks and in improved quality of life .
for obsessive-compulsive disorder , sertraline is not as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy ; the best results have been achieved by combining these two treatments .
although approved for social phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder , sertraline leads to only modest improvement in these conditions .
sertraline also alleviates the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and can be used in sub-therapeutic doses or intermittently for its treatment .
sertraline shares the common side effects and contraindications of other ssris , with high rates of nausea , diarrhea , insomnia , and sexual side effects ; however , it does not cause weight gain , and its effects on
in pregnant women taking sertraline , the drug was present in significant concentrations in fetal blood , and was also associated with a higher rate of various birth defects .
similarly to other antidepressants , the use of sertraline for depression may be associated with a higher rate of suicidality .
secretariat march 30 , 1970 ??? october 4 , 1989 was an american thoroughbred racehorse that in 1973 became the first u.s. triple crown champion in 25 years .
he set race records in all three events in the series ??? the kentucky derby 1:59.4 , the preakness stakes 1:53 , and the belmont stakes 2:24 ??? records that still stand today .
he is considered to be one of the greatest thoroughbreds of all time .
in 1999 , espn ranked secretariat the 35th best athlete of the 20th century , the highest ranking racehorse on the list url_http .
he ranked second behind man o ' war in the blood-horse 's list of the top 100 u.s. racehorses of the 20th century .
secretariat was sired by bold ruler out of somethingroyal , by princequillo .
he was foaled at the meadow in caroline county , virginia .
like his famous predecessor man o ' war , secretariat was a large chestnut colt and was given the same nickname , `` big red . ''
secretariat 's grandsire , nasrullah , is also the great-great-grandsire of 1977 triple crown winner seattle slew .
owned by penny chenery , he was trained by lucien laurin and mainly ridden by canadian jockey ron turcotte , along with apprentice jockey paul feliciano first two races , and veteran eddie maple last race
he raced in chenery 's meadow stable 's blue and white checkered colors and his groom was eddie sweat .

a typical 12 v , 40 ah lead-acid car battery
an automotive battery is a type of rechargeable battery that supplies electric energy to an automobile .
usually this refers to an sli battery starting , lighting , ignition to power the starter motor , the lights , and the ignition system of a vehicle ??? s engine .
automotive sli batteries are usually lead-acid type , and are made of six galvanic cells in series to provide a 12 volt system .
each cell provides 2.1 volts for a total of 12.6 volt at full charge .
heavy vehicles such as highway trucks or tractors , often equipped with diesel engines , may have two batteries in series for a 24 volt system , or may have parallel strings of batteries .
lead-acid batteries are made up of plates of lead and separate plates of lead dioxide , which are submerged into an electrolyte solution of about 38 % sulfuric acid and 62 % water .
this causes a chemical reaction that releases electrons , allowing them to flow through conductors to produce electricity .
as the battery discharges , the acid of the electrolyte reacts with the materials of the plates , changing their surface to lead sulfate .
when the battery is recharged , the chemical reaction is reversed : the lead sulfate reforms into lead dioxide and lead .
with the plates restored to their original condition , the process may now be repeated .
battery recycling of automotive batteries reduces the need for resources required for manufacture of new batteries , diverts toxic lead from landfills , and prevents risk of improper disposal .
full-time employment is employment in which a person works a minimum number of hours defined as such by his\/her employer .
full-time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part-time , temporary , or flexible workers , such as annual leave , sickleave , and health insurance .
full-time jobs are often considered careers .
they generally pay more than part-time jobs , and usually carry more hours per week .
the fair labor standards act flsa does not define full-time employment or part-time employment .
this is a matter generally to be determined by the employer us department of labor .
the definition by employer can vary and is generally published in a company 's employee handbook .
companies commonly require from 30 ??? 35 or 40 hours per week to be defined as full-time and therefore eligible for benefits .
full-time status varies between company and is often based on the shift the employee must work during each work week .
the `` standard '' work week consists of five eight-hour days , commonly served between 9:00 am to 5:00 pm totaling 40 hours .
while a four-day week generally consists of four ten-hour days ; it may also consist of as little as nine hours for a total of a 36 hour work week .
twelve-hour shifts are often three days per week , unless the company has the intention of paying out the employee overtime .
overtime is legally paid out anytime an employee works more than 40 hours per week .
the legal minimum for overtime starts at base pay + one-half .
the increased payout is considered to compensate slightly for the increased fatigue which a person experiences on such long shifts .
shifts can also be very irregular , as in retail , but are still full-time if the required number of hours is reached .
there are some situations where a person who needs full-time work is dropped to part-time , which is sometimes a form of constructive dismissal to avoid paying unemployment benefits to a laid-off worker .
maya numerals
maya numerals are a vigesimal base - twenty numeral system used by the pre-columbian maya civilization .
the numerals are made up of three symbols ; zero shell shape , one a dot and five a bar .
for example , thirteen is written as three dots in a horizontal row above two horizontal lines stacked above each other .
big bird is a protagonist of the children 's television show sesame street .
officially performed by caroll spinney since 1969 , he is an eight-foot two-inch 249 cm tall bright primrose-yellow bird .
he can roller skate , ice skate , dance , sing , write poetry , draw and even ride a unicycle .
but despite this wide array of talents , he is prone to frequent misunderstandings , on one occasion even singing the alphabet as one big long word from the song called '' abc-def-ghi , '' pronounced `` ab-keddef-gajihkel-monop-quristuv-wixyz ''
he lives in a large nest behind the 123 sesame street brownstone and has a teddy bear named radar .
the second crusade 1145 ??? 1149 was the second major crusade launched from europe .
the second crusade was started in response to the fall of the county of edessa the previous year to the forces of zengi .
the county had been founded during the first crusade 1096 ??? 1099 by baldwin of boulogne in 1098 .
while it was the first crusader state to be founded , it was also the first to fall .
the second crusade was announced by pope eugene iii , and was the first of the crusades to be led by european kings , namely louis vii of france and conrad iii of germany , with help from a number
the armies of the two kings marched separately across europe .
after crossing byzantine territory into anatolia , both armies were separately defeated by the seljuq turks .

data warehouse overview
in computing , a data warehouse or enterprise data warehouse dw , dwh , or edw is a database used for reporting and data analysis .
it is a central repository of data which is created by integrating data from one or more disparate sources .
data warehouses store current as well as historical data and are used for creating trending reports for senior management reporting such as annual and quarterly comparisons .
the data stored in the warehouse are uploaded from the operational systems such as marketing , sales etc. , shown in the figure to the right .
the data may pass through an operational data store for additional operations before they are used in the dw for reporting .
the typical etl - based data warehouse uses staging , data integration , and access layers to house its key functions .
the staging layer or staging database stores raw data extracted from each of the disparate source data systems .
the integration layer integrates the disparate data sets by transforming the data from the staging layer often storing this transformed data in an operational data store ods database .
the integrated data are then moved to yet another database , often called the data warehouse database , where the data is arranged into hierarchical groups often called dimensions and into facts and aggregate facts .
the combination of facts and dimensions is sometimes called a star schema .
the access layer helps users retrieve data .
a data warehouse constructed from an integrated data source systems does not require etl , staging databases , or operational data store databases .
the integrated data source systems may be considered to be a part of a distributed operational data store layer .
data federation methods or data virtualization methods may be used to access the distributed integrated source data systems to consolidate and aggregate data directly into the data warehouse database tables .
unlike the etl-based data warehouse , the integrated source data systems and the data warehouse are all integrated since there is no transformation of dimensional or reference data .
this integrated data warehouse architecture supports the drill down from the aggregate data of the data warehouse to the transactional data of the integrated source data systems .
data warehouses can be subdivided into data marts .
data marts store subsets of data from a warehouse .
this definition of the data warehouse focuses on data storage .
the main source of the data is cleaned , transformed , cataloged and made available for use by managers and other business professionals for data mining , online analytical processing , market research and decision support marakas & o'brien
however , the means to retrieve and analyze data , to extract , transform and load data , and to manage the data dictionary are also considered essential components of a data warehousing system .
many references to data warehousing use this broader context .
thus , an expanded definition for data warehousing includes business intelligence tools , tools to extract , transform and load data into the repository , and tools to manage and retrieve metadata .

mormons self-identify as christian , though some of their beliefs differ from mainstream christianity .
mormons believe in the bible , as well as other books of scripture , such as the book of mormon .
they have a unique view of cosmology , and believe that all people are spirit-children of god .
mormons believe that returning to god requires following the example of jesus christ , and accepting his atonement through ordinances such as baptism .

a role-playing game rpg and sometimes roleplaying game is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting .
players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative , either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development .
actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines .
there are several forms of rpg .
the original form , sometimes called the tabletop rpg , is conducted through discussion , whereas in live action role-playing games larp players physically perform their characters ' actions .
in both of these forms , an arranger called a game master gm usually decides on the rules and setting to be used and acts as referee , while each of the other players plays the role of
several varieties of rpg also exist in electronic media , such as multi-player text-based muds and their graphics-based successors , massively multiplayer online role-playing games mmorpgs .
role-playing games also include single-player offline role-playing video games in which players control a character or team who undertake quests , and may include capabilities that advance using statistical mechanics .
these games often share settings and rules with tabletop rpgs , but emphasize character advancement more than collaborative storytelling .
despite this variety of forms , some game forms such as trading card games and wargames that are related to role-playing games may not be included .
role-playing activity may sometimes be present in such games , but it is not the primary focus .

the american civil war acw , also known as the war between the states or simply the civil war see naming , was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the united states
the war had its origin in the issue of slavery , especially the extension of slavery into the western territories .
foreign powers did not intervene .
after four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the south 's infrastructure , the confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished , and the difficult reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing
in the 1860 presidential election , republicans , led by abraham lincoln , opposed expanding slavery into united states ' territories .
lincoln won , but before his inauguration on march 4 , 1861 , seven cotton-based slave states formed the confederacy .
outgoing democratic president james buchanan and the incoming republicans rejected secession as illegal .
lincoln 's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war .
eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession .
confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the confederacy .
a peace conference failed to find a compromise , and both sides prepared for war .
the confederates assumed that european countries were so dependent on '' king cotton '' that they would intervene ; none did and none recognized the new confederate states of america .
hostilities began on april 12 , 1861 , when confederate forces fired upon fort sumter , a key fort held by union troops in south carolina .
lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort ; consequently , four more slave states joined the confederacy , bringing their total to eleven .
the union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy .
the eastern theater was inconclusive in 1861 ??? 62 .
the autumn 1862 confederate campaign into maryland a union state ended with confederate retreat at the battle of antietam , dissuading british intervention .
lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal .
to the west , by summer 1862 the union destroyed the confederate river navy , then much of their western armies , and the union at vicksburg split the confederacy in two at the mississippi river .
in 1863 , robert e. lee 's confederate incursion north ended at the battle of gettysburg .
western successes led to ulysses s. grant command of all union armies in 1864 .
in the western theater , william t. sherman drove east to capture atlanta and marched to the sea , destroying confederate infrastructure along the way .
the union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the confederacy from all directions , and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the overland campaign towards richmond , the confederate capital .
the defending confederate army failed , leading to lee 's surrender to grant at appomattox court house on april 9 , 1865 .
the american civil war was one of the earliest true industrial wars .
railroads , the telegraph , steamships , and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively .
the mobilization of civilian factories , mines , shipyards , banks , transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed world war i .
it remains the deadliest war in american history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties .
historian john huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all northern males 20 ??? 45 years old , and 30 percent of all southern white males aged 18 ??? 40 .

the song 's hook is a repeating guitar arpeggio using a delay effect , played during the song 's introduction and again at the end .

a new zealand forward in white takes a shot on goal against cameroon in the 2011 fifa u-20 world cup .
forwards , also known as strikers , are the players on a team in association football who play nearest to the opposing team 's goal , and are therefore principally responsible for scoring goals .
this very advanced position and its limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals than other players .
this position requires intelligence , speed , and power , both of execution and of thought , to perform the role well .
modern team formations usually include one to three forwards ; two is the most common .
coaches typically field one striker who plays in an advanced position the center forward , and another attacking forward who plays somewhat deeper and assists in making goals as well as scoring the second striker .
it should be noted that inside forwards develop from attacking midfield positions and hence are naturally midfielders .
barcelona fc star lionel messi is a typical attacking midfielder seen as a forward due to his shot accuracy .
a california domestic partnership is a legal relationship available to same-sex couples , and to certain opposite-sex couples in which at least one party is at least 18 years of age .
it affords the couple `` the same rights , protections , and benefits , and ... the same responsibilities , obligations , and duties under law ... '' as married spouses .
enacted in 1999 , the domestic partnership registry was the first of its kind in the united states created by a legislature without court intervention .
initially , domestic partnerships enjoyed very few privileges ??? principally just hospital-visitation rights and the right to be claimed as a next of kin of the estate of a deceased partner .
the legislature has since expanded the scope of california domestic partnerships to include all of the rights and responsibilities common to marriage .
as such , california domestic partnerships are functionally equivalent to civil unions offered in several other states .
although the program enjoys broad support in california , it has been the source of some controversy .
groups opposed to the recognition of same-sex families have challenged the expansion of domestic partnerships in court .
conversely , advocates of same-sex marriage contend that anything less than full marriage rights extended to same-sex partners is analogous to the `` separate but equal '' racial laws of the jim crow era .

the winning super bowl team receives the vince lombardi trophy .
the super bowl is an annual american football game that determines the champion of the national football league nfl .
the contest is held in an american city that is chosen three to four years beforehand , usually in warm-weather or domed sites .
since 1971 , the winner of the american football conference afc championship game has faced the winner of the national football conference nfc championship game in the culmination of the nfl playoffs .
before the 1970 merger between the american football league afl and the national football league nfl , the two leagues met in four such contests .
the first two were known as the `` afl-nfl world championship game . ''
super bowl iii in 1969 was the first such game that carried the `` super bowl '' moniker , the names '' super bowl i '' and '' super bowl ii '' were retroactively applied to the first two games
the nfc \/ nfl leads in super bowl wins with 25 , while the afc \/ afl has won 22 .
eighteen different franchises , including teams that relocated to another city , have won the super bowl .
the pittsburgh steelers have won the most super bowls with six championships record 6 ??? 2 , while both the dallas cowboys and san francisco 49ers have five wins each cowboys 5 ??? 3 ; 49ers 5
dallas and pittsburgh have the most super bowl appearances with eight , while the buffalo bills have the most consecutive appearances with four losses in a row from 1990 to 1993 .
the new england patriots , denver broncos and minnesota vikings have also lost a record four super bowls .
buffalo and minnesota are both 0 ??? 4 , denver is 2 ??? 4 and new england is 3 ??? 4 .
the record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises : the 1966-67 green bay packers , the 1972-73 miami dolphins , the 1974-75 and 1978-79 pittsburgh steelers the only team to accomplish this feat twice
the only team with multiple super bowl appearances and no losses is the baltimore ravens , who in winning super bowl xlvii unseated and replaced the 49ers in that position .
four current nfl teams have never appeared in a super bowl , including franchise relocations and renaming : the cleveland browns , detroit lions , jacksonville jaguars , and houston texans , though both the browns and lions had won
`` puff , the magic dragon '' is a song written by leonard lipton and peter yarrow , and made popular by yarrow 's group peter , paul and mary in a 1963 recording .
the song achieved great popularity .
the washington nationals are a professional baseball team based in washington , d.c.
the nationals are a member of the east division of the national league of major league baseball mlb .
the team 's home ballpark is nationals park , located on south capitol street in southeast d.c. , near the anacostia river .
the park opened in 2008 , replacing rfk stadium , the team 's home from 2005 to 2007 .
the nationals ' name derives from the former washington baseball team that had the same name used interchangeably with senators .
their nickname is `` the nats '' ??? a shortened version that was also used by the old d.c. teams .
an expansion franchise , the club was founded in as the montreal expos , the first major league team in canada .
they were based in montreal , quebec , and played their home games at jarry park stadium and later in olympic stadium .
in , the expos won a division championship , won their first-ever playoff series by defeating the philadelphia phillies , 3 ??? 2 , and advanced to the national league championship series , where they would go on to lose
the expos had their highest winning percentage in the strike-shortened season of , when the team had the best record in baseball .
the team 's subsequent shedding of players caused fan interest to drop off .
after the 2001 season , mlb considered revoking the team 's franchise , along with either the minnesota twins or the tampa bay devil rays .
after being purchased by mlb in 2002 , the team was moved before the season to washington and renamed the nationals , the first relocation since the second washington senators moved to arlington , texas , and became the texas
the nationals are one of two mlb franchises , and the only one in the national league , that has never played in a world series the seattle mariners are the other .
a contingent fee in the united states or conditional fee in england and wales is any fee for services provided where the fee is payable only if there is a favourable result .
in the law , it is defined as a `` fee charged for a lawyer 's services only if the lawsuit is successful or is favorably settled out of court ...
contingent fees are usually calculated as a percentage of the client 's net recovery . ''
in the english legal system , it is generally referred to as no win no fee .
a conditional fee agreement between a law firm and a client .
the usual form of this agreement is that the solicitor will take a law case on the understanding that if lost , no payment is made .
however , if the case is won , the lawyer will be entitled to the normal fee based on hourly billing , plus a success fee .
the success fee in england must be as a percentage no greater than 100 % of the normal fee .
this contrasts with the contingency fee in the us , which gives the successful attorney a percentage of the damages awarded in favor of his client .
this makes it easier for the poor to pursue their civil rights since otherwise , to sue someone for a tort , one must first be wealthy enough to pursue such litigation in the first place .
however , because of the high risk , few attorneys will take cases on a contingency basis unless they feel the case has good merit .
according to a 2004 book by law professor herbert kritzer , contingent fees were allowed as of that year in the following countries : australia , brazil , canada , the dominican republic , france , greece , ireland ,
they are also allowed in personal injury actions in lithuania .
recently , they have been allowed in belgium as well .
vetting is the process of performing a background check on someone before offering them employment , conferring an award , etc. .
a prospective person or project may be vetted before making a hiring decision .
in addition , in intelligence gathering , assets are vetted to determine their usefulness .
a graph of the us cpi from 1913 to 2006 in blue , and its percent annual change in red
a consumer price index cpi measures changes in the price level of a market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households .
the cpi in the united states is defined by the bureau of labor statistics as `` a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services
the cpi is a statistical estimate constructed using the prices of a sample of representative items whose prices are collected periodically .
sub-indexes and sub-sub-indexes are computed for different categories and sub-categories of goods and services , being combined to produce the overall index with weights reflecting their shares in the total of the consumer expenditures covered by the index .
it is one of several price indices calculated by most national statistical agencies .
the annual percentage change in a cpi is used as a measure of inflation .
a cpi can be used to index i.e. , adjust for the effect of inflation the real value of wages , salaries , pensions , for regulating prices and for deflating monetary magnitudes to show changes in real
in most countries , the cpi is , along with the population census and the usa national income and product accounts , one of the most closely watched national economic statistics .
knocking on wood , or to touch wood , refers to the apotropaic tradition in western folklore of literally touching\/knocking on wood , or merely stating that you are doing or intend same , in order to avoid '' tempting
rocker arm
generally referred to within the context of the internal combustion engine of automotive , marine , motorcycle and reciprocating aviation engines , the rocker arm is an oscillating lever that conveys radial movement from the cam lobe into linear movement
one end is raised and lowered by a rotating lobe of the camshaft either directly or via a tappet lifter and pushrod while the other end acts on the valve stem .
when the camshaft lobe raises the outside of the arm , the inside presses down on the valve stem , opening the valve .
when the outside of the arm is permitted to return due to the camshafts rotation , the inside rises , allowing the valve spring to close the valve .
the drive cam is driven by the camshaft .
this pushes the rocker arm up and down about the trunnion pin or rocker shaft .
friction may be reduced at the point of contact with the valve stem by a roller cam follower .
a similar arrangement transfers the motion via another roller cam follower to a second rocker arm .
this rotates about the rocker shaft , and transfers the motion via a tappet to the poppet valve .
in this case this opens the intake valve to the cylinder head .
the effective leverage of the arm and thus the force it can exert on the valve stem is determined by the rocker arm ratio , the ratio of the distance from the rocker arm 's center of rotation
current automotive design favors rocker arm ratios of about 1.5:1 to 1.8:1 .
however , in the past smaller positive ratios the valve lift is greater than the cam lift and even negative ratios valve lift smaller than the cam lift have been used .
many pre-ww2 engines use 1:1 neutral ratios .
for car engines the rocker arms are generally steel stampings , providing a reasonable balance of strength , weight and economical cost .
because the rocker arms are , in part , reciprocating weight , excessive mass especially at the lever ends limits the engine 's ability to reach high operating speeds .
`` the night the lights went out in georgia '' is a southern gothic song written by songwriter bobby russell and performed in 1972 by his then-wife vicki lawrence .
reba mcentire later covered it in 1991 .
recorded in late october 1972 in united\/western studios on sunset in hollywood and released less than two weeks later in november 1972 , the song centers around the older brother of the narrator , falsely convicted of and executed for
in postal mail , a return address is an explicit inclusion of the address of the person sending the message .
it provides the recipient and sometimes authorized intermediaries with a means to determine how to respond to the sender of the message if needed .
the return address need not include a sender 's name , but should include address or p.o. box details in the same way as the delivery address should .
in some countries , the return address is conventionally located in the upper left hand corner of the envelope , card , or label .
in the united kingdom , the return address is usually placed on the reverse of the envelope , near the top .
businesses often use envelopes preprinted with a return address .
many individuals have sheets of adhesive labels preprinted with their home address to affix to their correspondence .
charities sometimes include such sheets in mailshots .
rolls of return address labels can be purchased from companies that sell personalized labels to provide individuals an easy way to peel and stick return address labels to their envelopes .
the return address is not required on postal mail .
however , lack of a return address prevents the postal service from being able to return the item if it proves undeliverable ; such as from damage , postage due , or invalid destination .
such mail may thus become dead letter mail .
should the return address be of a different state or country , the mail may be routed through that location for ease of return .
a nerve guidance conduit also referred to as an artificial nerve conduit or artificial nerve graft , as opposed to an autograft is an artificial means of guiding axonal regrowth to facilitate nerve regeneration and is one of
when direct suturing of the two stumps of a severed nerve can not be accomplished without tension , the standard clinical treatment for peripheral nerve injuries is autologous nerve grafting .
due to the limited availability of donor tissue and functional recovery in autologous nerve grafting , neural tissue engineering research has focused on the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits as an alternative treatment , especially for large defects .
similar techniques are also being explored for nerve repair in the spinal cord but nerve regeneration in the central nervous system poses a greater challenge because its axons do not regenerate appreciably in their native environment .
the creation of artificial conduits is also known as entubulation because the nerve ends and intervening gap are enclosed within a tube composed of biological or synthetic materials .
whether the conduit is in the form of a biologic tube , synthetic tube or tissue-engineered conduit , it should facilitate neurotropic and neurotrophic communication between the proximal and distal ends of the nerve gap , block external inhibitory factors
the most basic objective of a nerve guidance conduit is to combine physical , chemical , and biological cues under conditions that will foster tissue formation .
materials that have been used to make biologic tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles , while nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from silicone and polyglycolide respectively .
tissue-engineered nerve guidance conduits are a combination of many elements : scaffold structure , scaffold material , cellular therapies , neurotrophic factors and biomimetic materials .
the choice of which physical , chemical and biological cues to use is based on the properties of the nerve environment , which is critical in creating the most desirable environment for axon regeneration .
the factors that control material selection include biocompatibility , biodegradability , mechanical integrity , controllability during nerve growth , implantation and sterilization .
amoxicillin bp
amoxicillin inn , formerly amoxycillin ban , and abbreviated amox , is a moderate-spectrum , bacteriolytic , ?? - lactam antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections caused by susceptible microorganisms .
it is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better absorbed , following oral administration , than other ?? - lactam antibiotics .
amoxicillin is one of the most common antibiotics prescribed for children .
the drug became available in 1972 .
amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by ?? - lactamase - producing bacteria , which are resistant to a broad spectrum of ?? - lactam antibiotics , such as penicillin .
for this reason , it is often combined with clavulanic acid , a ?? - lactamase inhibitor .
this increases effectiveness by reducing its susceptibility to ?? - lactamase resistance .
the american civil war acw , also known as the war between the states or simply the civil war see naming , was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the united states
the war had its origin in the issue of slavery , especially the extension of slavery into the western territories .
foreign powers did not intervene .
after four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the south 's infrastructure , the confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished , and the difficult reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing
in the 1860 presidential election , republicans , led by abraham lincoln , opposed expanding slavery into united states ' territories .
lincoln won , but before his inauguration on march 4 , 1861 , seven cotton-based slave states formed the confederacy .
outgoing democratic president james buchanan and the incoming republicans rejected secession as illegal .
lincoln 's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war .
eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession .
confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the confederacy .
a peace conference failed to find a compromise , and both sides prepared for war .
the confederates assumed that european countries were so dependent on '' king cotton '' that they would intervene ; none did and none recognized the new confederate states of america .
hostilities began on april 12 , 1861 , when confederate forces fired upon fort sumter , a key fort held by union troops in south carolina .
lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort ; consequently , four more slave states joined the confederacy , bringing their total to eleven .
the union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy .
the eastern theater was inconclusive in 1861 ??? 62 .
the autumn 1862 confederate campaign into maryland a union state ended with confederate retreat at the battle of antietam , dissuading british intervention .
lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal .
to the west , by summer 1862 the union destroyed the confederate river navy , then much of their western armies , and the union at vicksburg split the confederacy in two at the mississippi river .
in 1863 , robert e. lee 's confederate incursion north ended at the battle of gettysburg .
western successes led to ulysses s. grant command of all union armies in 1864 .
in the western theater , william t. sherman drove east to capture atlanta and marched to the sea , destroying confederate infrastructure along the way .
the union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the confederacy from all directions , and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the overland campaign towards richmond , the confederate capital .
the defending confederate army failed , leading to lee 's surrender to grant at appomattox court house on april 9 , 1865 .
the american civil war was one of the earliest true industrial wars .
railroads , the telegraph , steamships , and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively .
the mobilization of civilian factories , mines , shipyards , banks , transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed world war i .
it remains the deadliest war in american history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties .
historian john huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all northern males 20 ??? 45 years old , and 30 percent of all southern white males aged 18 ??? 40 .
human evolution refers to the evolutionary process leading up to the appearance of modern humans .
while it began with the last common ancestor of all life , the topic usually covers only the evolutionary history of primates , in particular the genus homo , and the emergence of homo sapiens as a distinct species of
the study of human evolution involves many scientific disciplines , including physical anthropology , primatology , archaeology , linguistics , evolutionary psychology , embryology and genetics .
according to genetic studies , primates diverged from other mammals about in the late cretaceous period , and the earliest fossils appear in the paleocene , around .
the family hominidae diverged from the hylobatidae gibbon family 15-20 million years ago , and around , the ponginae orangutans , diverged from the hominidae family .
bipedalism is the basic adaption of the hominin line , and the earliest bipedal hominin is considered to be either sahelanthropus or orrorin , with ardipithecus , a full bipedal , coming somewhat later .
the gorilla and chimpanzee diverged around the same time , about 4-6 million years ago , and either sahelanthropus or orrorin may be our last shared ancestor with them .
the early bipedals eventually evolved into the australopithecines and later the genus homo .
the earliest documented members of the genus homo are homo habilis which evolved around ; the earliest species for which there is positive evidence of use of stone tools .
the brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee .
during the next million years a process of encephalization began , and with the arrival of homo erectus in the fossil record , cranial capacity had doubled to 850 cm3 .
homo erectus and homo ergaster were the first of the hominina to leave africa , and these species spread through africa , asia , and europe between .
it is believed that these species were the first to use fire and complex tools .
according to the recent african ancestry theory , modern humans evolved in africa possibly from homo heidelbergensis , homo rhodesiensis or homo antecessor and migrated out of the continent some 50,000 to 100,000 years ago , replacing local populations of
archaic homo sapiens , the forerunner of anatomically modern humans , evolved between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago .
recent dna evidence suggests that several haplotypes of neanderthal origin are present among all non-african populations , and neanderthals and other hominids , such as denisova hominin may have contributed up to 6 % of their genome to present-day humans
the transition to behavioral modernity with the development of symbolic culture , language , and specialized lithic technology happened around 50,000 years ago according to many anthropologists although some suggest a gradual change in behavior over a longer time span
the gulf war 2 august 1990 ??? 28 february 1991 , codenamed operation desert storm 17 january 1991 ??? 28 february 1991 was a war waged by a u.n.-authorized coalition force from 34 nations led by
the war is also known under other names , such as the persian gulf war , first gulf war , gulf war i , or the first iraq war , before the term `` iraq war '' became identified instead
kuwait 's invasion by iraqi troops that began 2 august 1990 was met with international condemnation , and brought immediate economic sanctions against iraq by members of the u.n. security council .
u.s. president george h. w. bush deployed u.s. forces into saudi arabia , and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene .
an array of nations joined the coalition .
the great majority of the coalition 's military forces were from the u.s. , with saudi arabia , the united kingdom and egypt as leading contributors , in that order .
saudi arabia paid around us$ 36 billion of the us$ 60 billion cost .
the war was marked by the beginning of live news on the front lines of the fight , with the primacy of the u.s. network cnn .
the war has also earned the nickname video game war after the daily broadcast images on board the u.s. bombers during operation desert storm .
the initial conflict to expel iraqi troops from kuwait began with an aerial bombardment on 17 january 1991 .
this was followed by a ground assault on 24 february .
this was a decisive victory for the coalition forces , who liberated kuwait and advanced into iraqi territory .
the coalition ceased their advance , and declared a cease-fire 100 hours after the ground campaign started .
aerial and ground combat was confined to iraq , kuwait , and areas on saudi arabia 's border .
iraq launched scud missiles against coalition military targets in saudi arabia and against israel .
the nickel , in american usage , is a five - cent coin issued by the united states mint .
composed of 75 % copper and 25 % nickel , the piece has been struck since 1866 .
the silver half dime , equal to five cents , had been issued since the 1790s .
the american civil war caused economic hardship , driving gold and silver from circulation ; in response , in place of low-value coins , the government at first issued paper currency .
in 1865 , congress abolished the five-cent fractional currency note after spencer m. clark , head of the currency bureau today the bureau of engraving and printing , placed his own portrait on the denomination .
after successful introduction of two-cent and three-cent pieces , without precious metal , congress also authorized a five-cent piece consisting of base metal ; the mint began striking this version in 1866 .
the initial design of the shield nickel was struck until 1883 , then replaced by the liberty head nickel .
the buffalo nickel was introduced in 1913 as part of a drive to increase the beauty of american coinage ; in 1938 , the jefferson nickel followed .
in 2004 and 2005 , special designs in honor of the bicentennial of the lewis and clark expedition were issued .
in 2006 , the mint reverted to using jefferson nickel designer felix schlag 's original reverse or `` tails '' side , although a new obverse , by jamie franki , was substituted .
as of 2013 , it costs more than eleven cents to produce a nickel ; the mint is exploring the possibility of reducing cost by using less expensive metals .
the mcdonnell douglas now boeing f-15 eagle is a twin-engine , all-weather tactical fighter designed by mcdonnell douglas to gain and maintain air superiority in aerial combat .
it is considered among the most successful modern fighters , with over 100 aerial combat victories with no losses in dogfights .
following reviews of proposals , the united states air force selected mcdonnell douglas ' design in 1967 to meet the service 's need for a dedicated air superiority fighter .
the eagle first flew in july 1972 , and entered service in 1976 .
since the 1970s , the eagle has been exported to israel , japan , saudi arabia , and other nations .
the f-15 was originally envisioned as a pure air superiority aircraft .
its design included a secondary ground-attack capability that was largely unused .
the design proved flexible enough that an all-weather strike derivative , the f-15e strike eagle , was later developed , and entered service in 1989 .
the f-15 eagle is expected to be in service with the u.s. air force past 2025 .
christopher columbus italian : cristoforo colombo ; spanish : crist ?? bal col ?? n ; portuguese : crist ?? v ?? o colombo ; before 31 october 145120 may 1506 was an italian explorer , navigator ,
under the auspices of the catholic monarchs of spain , he completed four voyages across the atlantic ocean that led to general european awareness of the american continents .
those voyages , and his efforts to establish permanent settlements on the island of hispaniola , initiated the spanish colonization of the new world .
in the context of emerging western imperialism and economic competition between european kingdoms seeking wealth through the establishment of trade routes and colonies , columbus 's speculative proposal , to reach the east indies by sailing westward , eventually received
during his first voyage in 1492 , instead of reaching japan as he had intended , columbus landed in the bahamas archipelago , at a locale he named san salvador .
over the course of three more voyages , columbus visited the greater and lesser antilles , as well as the caribbean coast of venezuela and central america , claiming them for the spanish empire .
though columbus was not the first european explorer to reach the americas having been preceded by the norse expedition led by leif ericson in the 11th century , columbus 's voyages led to the first lasting european contact
they had , therefore , an enormous impact in the historical development of the modern western world .
columbus himself saw his accomplishments primarily in the light of the spreading of the christian religion .
never admitting that he had reached a continent previously unknown to europeans , rather than the east indies he had set out for , columbus called the inhabitants of the lands he visited indios spanish for '' indians ''
columbus 's strained relationship with the spanish crown and its appointed colonial administrators in america led to his arrest and dismissal as governor of the settlements on the island of hispaniola in 1500 , and later to protracted litigation over
bred in germany , the boxer is a breed of stocky , medium-sized , short-haired dogs .
the coat is smooth and tight-fitting ; colors are fawn or brindled , with or without white markings , which may cover the entire body .
boxers are brachycephalic they have broad , short skulls , and have a square muzzle , mandibular prognathism an underbite , very strong jaws , and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey
the boxer was bred from the old english bulldog and the now extinct bullenbeisser , and is part of the molosser group .
boxers were first exhibited in a dog show for st. bernards in munich in 1895 , the first boxer club being founded the next year .
based on 2012 american kennel club statistics , boxers held steady as the seventh most popular breed of dog in the united states for the third consecutive year .
serial ata sata is a computer bus interface that connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices such as hard disk drives and optical drives .
serial ata replaces the older at attachment standard ata ; later referred to as parallel ata or pata , offering several advantages over the older interface : reduced cable size and cost seven conductors instead of 40
sata host adapters and devices communicate via a high-speed serial cable over two pairs of conductors .
in contrast , parallel ata the redesignation for the legacy ata specifications used a 16-bit wide data bus with many additional support and control signals , all operating at much lower frequency .
to ensure backward compatibility with legacy ata software and applications , sata uses the same basic ata and atapi command-set as legacy ata devices .
sata has replaced parallel ata in consumer desktop and laptop computers , and has largely replaced pata in new embedded applications .
sata 's market share in the desktop pc market was 99 % in 2008 .
pata remains widely used in industrial and embedded applications that use compactflash storage , even though the new cfast standard is based on sata .
serial ata industry compatibility specifications originate from the serial ata international organization aka .
sata-io , serialata.org .
the sata-io group collaboratively creates , reviews , ratifies , and publishes the interoperability specifications , the test cases , and plug-fests .
as with many other industry compatibility standards , the sata content ownership is transferred to other industry bodies : primarily the incits t13 subcommittee ata , the incits t10 subcommittee scsi ; a subgroup of t10 responsible for
the complete specification from sata-io .
the remainder of this article will try to use the terminology and specifications of sata-io .
the history of the internet began with the development of electronic computers in the 1950s .
the public was first introduced to the concepts that would lead to the internet when a message was sent over the arpanet from computer science professor leonard kleinrock 's laboratory at university of california , los angeles ucla
packet switched networks such as arpanet , mark i at npl in the uk , cyclades , merit network , tymnet , and telenet , were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of protocols .
the arpanet in particular led to the development of protocols for internetworking , in which multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks .
in 1982 , the internet protocol suite tcp\/ip was standardized , and consequently , the concept of a world-wide network of interconnected tcp\/ip networks , called the internet , was introduced .
access to the arpanet was expanded in 1981 when the national science foundation nsf developed the computer science network csnet and again in 1986 when nsfnet provided access to supercomputer sites in the united states from
commercial internet service providers isps began to emerge in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
the arpanet was decommissioned in 1990 .
the internet was commercialized in 1995 when nsfnet was decommissioned , removing the last restrictions on the use of the internet to carry commercial traffic .
since the mid-1990s , the internet has had a revolutionary impact on culture and commerce , including the rise of near-instant communication by electronic mail , instant messaging , voice over internet protocol voip `` phone calls ''
the research and education community continues to develop and use advanced networks such as nsf 's very high speed backbone network service vbns , internet2 , and national lambdarail .
increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-gbit\/s , 10-gbit\/s , or more .
the internet 's takeover over the global communication landscape was almost instant in historical terms : it only communicated 1 % of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications networks in the year 1993 , already 51 % by 2000 ,
today the internet continues to grow , driven by ever greater amounts of online information , commerce , entertainment , and social networking .
`` this is just to say '' 1934 is a famous imagist poem by william carlos williams .
professor albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore is a major character and protagonist of j. k. rowling 's harry potter series .
for most of the series , he is the headmaster of the wizarding school hogwarts .
as part of his backstory , it is revealed that he is the founder and leader of the order of the phoenix , an organization dedicated to fighting the main antagonist of the series , lord voldemort .
dumbledore is portrayed by richard harris in the film adaptions of harry potter and the philosopher 's stone and harry potter and the chamber of secrets .
after harris ' death , michael gambon portrayed dumbledore for all of the remaining films .
rowling stated she chose the name dumbledore , which is an early modern english word for '' bumblebee '' , because of dumbledore 's love of music : she imagined him walking around `` humming to himself a lot ''
calcitonin also known as thyrocalcitonin is a 32-amino acid linear polypeptide hormone that is produced in humans primarily by the parafollicular cells also known as c-cells of the thyroid , and in many other animals in
it acts to reduce blood calcium ca2 + , opposing the effects of parathyroid hormone pth .
calcitonin has been found in fish , reptiles , birds , and mammals .
its importance in humans has not been as well established as its importance in other animals , as its function is usually not significant in the regulation of normal calcium homeostasis .
it belongs to calcitonin-like protein family .

before humans went into space , several animals were launched into space , including numerous monkeys , so that scientists could investigate the biological effects of space travel .
the united states launched flights containing primate cargo primarily between 1948-1961 with one flight in 1969 and one in 1985 .
france launched two monkey-carrying flights in 1967 .
the soviet union and russia launched monkeys between 1983 and 1996 .
most monkeys were anesthetized before lift-off .
overall thirty-two monkeys flew in the space program ; none flew more than once .
numerous back-up monkeys also went through the programs but never flew .
monkeys from several species were used , including rhesus monkeys , cynomolgus monkeys , squirrel monkeys , and pig-tailed macaques .
some chimpanzees which are apes rather than monkeys were also used .
grits refers to a ground-corn food of native american origin , that is common in the southern united states and mainly eaten at breakfast .
modern grits are commonly made of alkali-treated corn known as hominy .
grits are similar to other thick maize-based porridges from around the world such as polenta or the thinner farina .
`` instant grits '' have been processed to speed cooking .
the word `` grits '' derives from the old english word '' grytt , '' meaning coarse meal .
this word originally referred to wheat and other porridges now known as groats in parts of the u.k. .
maize , unknown in europe in the middle ages , is a food derived from corn a new world plant and `` corn '' had been used to describe wheat products in many european regions .
`` grits '' may be either singular or plural ; historically , in the american south the word was invariably singular notwithstanding its plural form cf. such food names as `` spaghetti '' or `` linguine '' , likewise

the las vegas strip world of coca-cola museum in 2003
coca-cola is a carbonated soft drink sold in stores , restaurants , and vending machines in every country except cuba and north korea .
it is produced by the coca-cola company of atlanta , georgia , and is often referred to simply as coke a registered trademark of the coca-cola company in the united states since march 27 , 1944 .
originally intended as a patent medicine when it was invented in the late 19th century by john pemberton , coca-cola was bought out by businessman asa griggs candler , whose marketing tactics led coke to its dominance of the world
the company produces concentrate , which is then sold to licensed coca-cola bottlers throughout the world .
the bottlers , who hold territorially exclusive contracts with the company , produce finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate in combination with filtered water and sweeteners .
the bottlers then sell , distribute and merchandise coca-cola to retail stores and vending machines .
such bottlers include coca-cola enterprises , which is the largest single coca-cola bottler in north america and western europe .
the coca-cola company also sells concentrate for soda fountains to major restaurants and food service distributors .
the coca-cola company has , on occasion , introduced other cola drinks under the coke brand name .
the most common of these is diet coke , with others including caffeine-free coca-cola , diet coke caffeine-free , coca-cola cherry , coca-cola zero , coca-cola vanilla , and special versions with lemon , lime or coffee .
based on interbrand 's best global brand 2011 , coca-cola was the world 's most valuable brand .
an ombudsman is an official , usually appointed by the government or by parliament but with a significant degree of independence , who is charged with representing the interests of the public by investigating and addressing complaints of maladministration or
in some countries an inspector general , citizen advocate or other official may have duties similar to those of a national ombudsman , and may also be appointed by the legislature .
below the national level an ombudsman may be appointed by a state , local or municipal government , and unofficial ombudsmen may be appointed by , or even work for , a corporation such as a utility supplier or a
whether appointed by the legislature , the executive , or an organization or , less frequently , elected by the constituency that he or she serves , the typical duties of an ombudsman are to investigate complaints and
ombudsmen sometimes also aim to identify systemic issues leading to poor service or breaches of people 's rights .
at the national level , most ombudsmen have a wide mandate to deal with the entire public sector , and sometimes also elements of the private sector for example , contracted service providers .
in some cases , there is a more restricted mandate , for example with particular sectors of society .
more recent developments have included the creation of specialised children 's ombudsman and information commissioner agencies .
in some jurisdictions an ombudsman charged with the handling of concerns about national government is more formally referred to as the `` parliamentary commissioner '' e.g. the united kingdom parliamentary commissioner for administration , and the western australian state
in many countries where the ombudsman 's remit extends beyond dealing with alleged maladministration to promoting and protecting human rights , the ombudsman is recognized as the national human rights institution .
the post of ombudsman had by the end of the 20th century been instituted by most governments and by some intergovernmental organizations such as the european union .
making a complaint to an ombudsman is usually free of charge .

new england is a region in the northeastern corner of the united states consisting of the six states of maine , new hampshire , vermont , massachusetts , rhode island , and connecticut .
new england is bordered by new york state to the southwest , quebec to the northwest , and new brunswick and the atlantic ocean to the east .
in one of the earliest english settlements in north america , pilgrims from england first settled in new england in 1620 , to form plymouth colony .
ten years later , the puritans settled north of plymouth colony in boston , thus forming massachusetts bay colony .
over the next 130 years , new england fought in four french and indian wars , until the british defeated the french and their native allies in north america .
in the late 18th century , the new england colonies initiated the resistance to the british parliament 's efforts to impose new taxes without the consent of the colonists .
the boston tea party was a protest to which great britain responded with a series of punitive laws stripping massachusetts of self-government , which were termed the '' intolerable acts '' by the colonists .
the confrontation led to open warfare in 1775 , the expulsion of the british authorities from new england in spring 1776 , and the declaration of independence in july 1776 .
some of the first movements of american literature , philosophy , and education originated in new england .
the region played a prominent role in the movement to abolish slavery , and was the first region of the united states to be transformed by the industrial revolution .
today , new england is a major world center of education , high technology , insurance , and medicine .
boston is its cultural , financial , educational , medical and transportation center .
each state is principally subdivided into small incorporated municipalities known as new england towns , which are often governed by town meeting .
the only unincorporated territory in new england exists in the sparse , northern regions of vermont , new hampshire , and maine .
since 1970 , voters have more often supported liberal candidates at the state and federal level than those of any other region in the united states .
new england is the only one of the united states census bureau 's nine regional divisions whose name does not derive from its geography , and it is the only multi-state region with clear , consistent boundaries .
it maintains a strong sense of cultural identity set apart from the rest of the country , although the terms of this identity are often contested , combining puritanism with liberalism , agrarian life with industry , and isolation with

a plaque commemorating the location of the sarajevo assassination image taken in 2009
on 28 june 1914 , archduke franz ferdinand of austria , heir presumptive to the austro-hungarian throne , and his wife , sophie , duchess of hohenberg , were shot dead in sarajevo , by gavrilo princip , one of
the political objective of the assassination was to break off austria-hungary 's south-slav provinces so they could be combined into a greater serbia or a yugoslavia .
the assassins ' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as young bosnia .
serbian military officers stood behind the attack .
at the top of these serbian military conspirators was chief of serbian military intelligence dragutin dimitrijevi ?? , his righthand man major vojislav tankosi ?? , and masterspy rade malobabi ?? .
major tankosi ?? armed the assassins with bombs and pistols and trained them .
the assassins were given access to the same clandestine tunnel of safe-houses and agents that rade malobabi ?? used for the infiltration of weapons and operatives into austria-hungary .
the assassins , the key members of the clandestine tunnel , and the key serbian military conspirators who were still alive were arrested , tried , convicted and punished .
those who were arrested in bosnia were tried in sarajevo in october 1914 .
the other conspirators were arrested and tried before a serbian kangaroo court on the french-controlled salonika front in 1916 ??? 1917 on unrelated false charges ; serbia executed three of the top military conspirators .
much of what is known about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records .
assignment of responsibility for the bombing and murders of 28 june is highly controversial because the attack led to the outbreak of world war i one month later .

linen is a textile made from the fibers of the flax plant , linum usitatissimum .
linen is labor-intensive to manufacture , but when it is made into garments , it is valued for its exceptional coolness and freshness in hot weather .
the word `` linen '' is of west germanic origin and cognates with the latin name for the flax plant linum , and the earlier greek ?????????? linon .
this word history has given rise to a number of other terms in english , the most notable of which is the english word line , derived from the use of a linen flax thread to determine a
textiles in a linen weave texture , even when made of cotton , hemp and other non-flax fibers are also loosely referred to as `` linen '' .
such fabrics generally have their own specific names other than linen ; for example , fine cotton yarn in a linen-style weave is called madapolam .
the collective term '' linens '' is still often used generically to describe a class of woven and even knitted bed , bath , table and kitchen textiles .
the name linens is retained because traditionally , linen was used for many of these items .
in the past , the word `` linens '' was also used to mean lightweight undergarments such as shirts , chemises , waistshirts , lingerie a word also cognate with linen , and detachable shirt collars and cuffs
the inside cloth layer of fine composite clothing garments as for example jackets was traditionally made of linen , and this is the origin of the word lining .
linen textiles appear to be some of the oldest in the world : their history goes back many thousands of years .
fragments of straw , seeds , fibers , yarns , and various types of fabrics which date back to about 8000 bc have been found in swiss lake dwellings .
dyed flax fibers found in a prehistoric cave in georgia suggest the use of woven linen fabrics from wild flax may date back even earlier to 36,000 bp .
linen was sometimes used as currency in ancient egypt .
egyptian mummies were wrapped in linen because it was seen as a symbol of light and purity , and as a display of wealth .
some of these fabrics , woven from hand spun yarns , were very fine for their day , but are coarse compared to modern linen .
today , linen is usually an expensive textile , and is produced in relatively small quantities .
it has a long `` staple '' individual fiber length relative to cotton and other natural fibers .

sample of a medallion signature guarantee stampin
the united states and canada , a medallion signature guarantee is a special signature guarantee for the transfer of securities .
it is a guarantee by the transferring financial institution that the signature is genuine and the financial institution accepts liability for any forgery .
signature guarantees protect shareholders by preventing unauthorized transfers and possible investor losses .
they also limit the liability of the transfer agent who accepts the certificates .
different institutions have different policies as to what type of identification they require to provide the guarantee and whether they charge a fee for such service usually nominal if any .
most institutions will not guarantee a signature of someone who has not already been their customer .
a medallion signature guarantee is not the same as an acknowledgment by a notary public , in the sense that a `` signature guarantee '' is a certification by the institution that the signature is authentic , and an acknowledgment
some banks may no longer provide this service , however , many still do as well as other financial institutions such as a savings and loans and credit unions .
at their sole discretion , these institutions may still decline to provide the medallion signature guarantees .
when us citizens are abroad , some financial institutions may accept united states embassy seals , in place of the medallion signature guarantee stamp .

a thin film is a layer of material ranging from fractions of a nanometer monolayer to several micrometers in thickness .
electronic semiconductor devices and optical coatings are the main applications benefiting from thin-film construction .
a familiar application of thin films is the household mirror , which typically has a thin metal coating on the back of a sheet of glass to form a reflective interface .
the process of silvering was once commonly used to produce mirrors .
a very-thin-film coating less than a nanometer thick is used to produce two-way mirrors .
the performance of optical coatings e.g. antireflective , or ar , coatings are typically enhanced when the thin-film coating consists of multiple layers having varying thicknesses and refractive indices .
similarly , a periodic structure of alternating thin films of different materials may collectively form a so-called superlattice which exploits the phenomenon of quantum confinement by restricting electronic phenomena to two-dimensions .
work is being done with ferromagnetic and ferroelectric thin films for use as computer memory .
it is also being applied to pharmaceuticals , via thin-film drug delivery .
thin-films are used to produce thin-film batteries .
thin films are also used in dye-sensitized solar cells .
ceramic thin films are in wide use .
the relatively high hardness and inertness of ceramic materials make this type of thin coating of interest for protection of substrate materials against corrosion , oxidation and wear .
in particular , the use of such coatings on cutting tools can extend the life of these items by several orders of magnitude .
research is being done on a new class of thin-film inorganic oxide materials , called amorphous heavy-metal cation multicomponent oxides , which could be used to make transparent transistors that are inexpensive , stable , and environmentally benign .

the driver and passenger front airbags , after having been deployed , in a british peugeot 306 car .
an airbag is a vehicle safety device .
it is an occupant restraint system consisting of a flexible fabric envelope or cushion designed to inflate rapidly during an automobile collision .
its purpose is to cushion occupants during a crash and provide protection to their bodies when they strike interior objects such as the steering wheel or a window .
modern vehicles may contain multiple airbag modules in various side and frontal locations of the passenger seating positions , and sensors may deploy one or more airbags in an impact zone at variable rates based on the type , angle
airbags are normally designed with the intention of supplementing the protection of an occupant who is correctly restrained with a seatbelt .
most designs are inflated through pyrotechnic means and can only be operated once .
newer side-impact airbag modules consist of compressed air cylinders that are triggered in the event of a side impact vehicle impact .
the first commercial designs were introduced in passenger automobiles during the 1970s with limited success .
broad commercial adoption of airbags occurred in many markets during the late 1980s and early 1990s with a driver airbag , and a front passenger airbag as well on some cars ; and many modern vehicles now include four or

world war i wwi was a global war centred in europe that began on 28 july 1914 and lasted until 11 november 1918 .
it was predominantly called the world war or the great war from its occurrence until the start of world war ii in 1939 , and the first world war or world war i thereafter .
it involved all the world 's great powers , which were assembled in two opposing alliances : the allies based on the triple entente of the united kingdom , france and russia and the central powers originally
these alliances were both reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : italy , japan and the united states joined the allies , and the ottoman empire and bulgaria the central powers .
ultimately , more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history .
more than 9 million combatants were killed , largely because of technological advancements that led to enormous increases in the lethality of weapons without corresponding improvements in protection or mobility .
it was the fifth - deadliest conflict in world history , subsequently paving the way for various political changes , such as revolutions in many of the nations involved .
one of the long-term causes of the war was the resurgence of imperialism in the foreign policies of the great powers of europe .
more immediately , the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand of austria , the heir to the throne of austria-hungary , on 28 june 1914 by yugoslav nationalist gavrilo princip in sarajevo triggered a diplomatic crisis when austria-hungary subsequently delivered an
several alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked .
within weeks , the major powers were at war and , via their colonies , the conflict soon spread around the world .
on 28 july , the austro-hungarians fired the first shots of the war as preparation for the invasion of serbia .
while the russians mobilised , the germans invaded neutral belgium and luxembourg on the way to france , providing a casus belli for britain 's declaration of war against germany .
after the german march on paris was brought to a halt ??? the so-called miracle of the marne ??? the western front settled into a static battle of attrition with a trench line that changed little until 1917 .
on the eastern front , the russian army was successful against the austro-hungarians , but was stopped in its invasion of east prussia by the germans .
in november the ottoman empire joined the war , opening up fronts in the caucasus , mesopotamia and the sinai .
italy and bulgaria went to war in 1915 and romania in 1916 .
in russia , the tsar 's government collapsed in march 1917 and a subsequent revolution in november brought the russians to terms with the central powers .
after a 1918 german offensive along the western front , the allies drove back the germans in a series of successful offensives and american forces began entering the trenches .
germany , which had its own trouble with revolutionaries , agreed to an armistice on 11 november 1918 .
the war ended in victory for the allies .
events on the home fronts were as tumultuous as on the battle fronts , as the participants tried to mobilize their manpower and economic resources to fight a total war .
by the end of the war , four major imperial powers ??? the german , russian , austro-hungarian and ottoman empires ??? ceased to exist .
the successor states of the former two lost a great amount of territory , while the latter two were dismantled entirely .
the map of central europe was redrawn into several smaller states .
the league of nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict .
the european nationalism spawned by the war and the breakup of empires , the repercussions of germany 's defeat and problems with the treaty of versailles are agreed to be factors contributing to world war ii .

afghanistan ; ; , officially the islamic republic of afghanistan , is a landlocked sovereign state forming part of south asia , central asia , and to some extent western asia .
it has a population of around 30 million inhabiting an area of approximately , making it the 42nd most populous and 41st largest nation in the world .
it is bordered by pakistan in the south and the east , iran in the west , turkmenistan , uzbekistan and tajikistan in the north , and china in the far northeast .
afghanistan has been an ancient focal point of the silk road and human migration .
archaeologists have found evidence of human habitation from as far back as the middle paleolithic .
urban civilization may have begun in the area as early as 3,000 to 2,000 bce .
sitting at an important geostrategic location that connects the middle east culture with central asia and the indian subcontinent , the land has been home to various peoples through the ages and witnessed many military campaigns , notably by alexander
the land also served as a source from which the greco-bactrians , kushans , hephthalites , saffarids , ghaznavids , ghorids , khiljis , timurids , mughals , durranis , and others have risen to form major empires .
the political history of the modern state of afghanistan begins in 1709 , when the hotaki dynasty was established in kandahar followed by ahmad shah durrani 's rise to power in 1747 .
in the late 19th century , afghanistan became a buffer state in the '' great game '' between the british and russian empires .
following the 1919 anglo-afghan war , king amanullah began a european style modernization of the country but was stopped by the ultra-conservatives .
during the cold war , after the withdrawal of the british from neighboring india in 1947 , the united states and the soviet union began spreading influences in afghanistan , which led to a bloody war between the us-backed mujahideen
this was followed by the 1990s civil war , the rise and fall of the extremist taliban government and the 2001 ??? present war .
in december 2001 , the united nations security council authorized the creation of the international security assistance force isaf to help maintain security in afghanistan and assist the karzai administration .
three decades of war made afghanistan one of the world 's most dangerous countries , including the largest producer of refugees and asylum seekers .
while the international community is rebuilding war-torn afghanistan , terrorist groups such as the haqqani network and hezbi islami are actively involved in a nationwide taliban - led insurgency , which includes hundreds of assassinations and suicide attacks .
according to the united nations , the insurgents were responsible for 80 % of civilian casualties in 2011 and 2012 .
the american civil war acw , also known as the war between the states or simply the civil war see naming , was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the united states
the war had its origin in the issue of slavery , especially the extension of slavery into the western territories .
foreign powers did not intervene .
after four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the south 's infrastructure , the confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished , and the difficult reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing
in the 1860 presidential election , republicans , led by abraham lincoln , opposed expanding slavery into united states ' territories .
lincoln won , but before his inauguration on march 4 , 1861 , seven cotton-based slave states formed the confederacy .
outgoing democratic president james buchanan and the incoming republicans rejected secession as illegal .
lincoln 's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war .
eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession .
confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the confederacy .
a peace conference failed to find a compromise , and both sides prepared for war .
the confederates assumed that european countries were so dependent on '' king cotton '' that they would intervene ; none did and none recognized the new confederate states of america .
hostilities began on april 12 , 1861 , when confederate forces fired upon fort sumter , a key fort held by union troops in south carolina .
lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort ; consequently , four more slave states joined the confederacy , bringing their total to eleven .
the union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy .
the eastern theater was inconclusive in 1861 ??? 62 .
the autumn 1862 confederate campaign into maryland a union state ended with confederate retreat at the battle of antietam , dissuading british intervention .
lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal .
to the west , by summer 1862 the union destroyed the confederate river navy , then much of their western armies , and the union at vicksburg split the confederacy in two at the mississippi river .
in 1863 , robert e. lee 's confederate incursion north ended at the battle of gettysburg .
western successes led to ulysses s. grant command of all union armies in 1864 .
in the western theater , william t. sherman drove east to capture atlanta and marched to the sea , destroying confederate infrastructure along the way .
the union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the confederacy from all directions , and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the overland campaign towards richmond , the confederate capital .
the defending confederate army failed , leading to lee 's surrender to grant at appomattox court house on april 9 , 1865 .
the american civil war was one of the earliest true industrial wars .
railroads , the telegraph , steamships , and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively .
the mobilization of civilian factories , mines , shipyards , banks , transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed world war i .
it remains the deadliest war in american history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties .
historian john huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all northern males 20 ??? 45 years old , and 30 percent of all southern white males aged 18 ??? 40 .

stacked and standing car tires
a tire or tyre is a ring-shaped covering that fits around a wheel 's rim to protect it and enable better vehicle performance .
most tires , such as those for automobiles and bicycles , provide traction between the vehicle and the road while providing a flexible cushion that absorbs shock .
the materials of modern pneumatic tires are synthetic rubber , natural rubber , fabric and wire , along with carbon black and other chemical compounds .
they consist of a tread and a body .
the tread provides traction while the body provides containment for a quantity of compressed air .
before rubber was developed , the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal that fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear .
early rubber tires were solid not pneumatic .
today , the majority of tires are pneumatic inflatable structures , comprising a doughnut-shaped body of cords and wires encased in rubber and generally filled with compressed air to form an inflatable cushion .
pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles , including cars , bicycles , motorcycles , trucks , earthmovers , and aircraft .
metal tires are still used on locomotives and railcars , and solid rubber or other polymer tires are still used in various non-automotive applications , such as some casters , carts , lawnmowers , and wheelbarrows .

warren participated in the next day 's battles of lexington and concord , which are commonly considered to be the opening engagements of the american revolutionary war .
warren had been commissioned a major general in the colony 's militia shortly before the june 17 , 1775 battle of bunker hill .
rather than exercising his rank , warren served in the battle as a private soldier , and was killed in combat when british troops stormed the redoubt atop breed 's hill .
his death , immortalized in john trumbull 's painting , the death of general warren at the battle of bunker 's hill , june 17 , 1775 , galvanized the rebel forces , and he has been memorialized in many

uncooked rouladen
rouladen or rinderroulade , singular : roulade is a german meat roulade usually consisting of bacon , onions , mustard and pickles wrapped in thinly sliced beef which is then cooked .
in some countries , the roulade is also known as `` beef olive '' .
beef or veal is used as meat though some food scholars tend to believe that the original version was probably venison or pork , and pork is still popular in some areas .
the beef rouladen as we know them today have become popular over the last century .
the cut is usually topside beef or silverside since this is the cheaper cut .
the more expensive version would be the round steak , also known as rump steak .
the meat is cut into large , thin slices .
the filling is a mixture of smoked and cooked pork belly , chopped onions and chopped pickles gurken which is at times varied by adding minced meat , sausage meat , pine nuts and mustard .
the mixture varies from region to region .
rouladen are traditionally served for dinner .
red wine is often served with this dish .

cellular respiration is the set of the metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate atp , and then release waste products .
the reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions , which break large molecules into smaller ones , releasing energy in the process as weak so-called `` high-energy '' bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products .
respiration is one of the key ways a cell gains useful energy to fuel cellular activity .
cellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction .
the overall reaction is broken into many smaller ones when it occurs in the body , most of which are redox reactions themselves .
although technically , cellular respiration is a combustion reaction , it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell .
this difference is because it occurs in many separate steps .
while the overall reaction is a combustion reaction , no single reaction that comprises it is a combustion reaction .
nutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar , amino acids and fatty acids , and a common oxidizing agent electron acceptor is molecular oxygen o2 .
the energy stored in atp its third phosphate group is weakly bonded to the rest of the molecule and is cheaply broken allowing stronger bonds to form , thereby transferring energy for use by the cell can then
lapping is a machining process , in which two surfaces are rubbed together with an abrasive between them , by hand movement or by way of a machine .
this can take two forms .
the first type of lapping traditionally called grinding , typically involves rubbing a brittle material such as glass against a surface such as iron or glass itself also known as the `` lap '' or grinding tool
this produces microscopic conchoidal fractures as the abrasive rolls about between the two surfaces and removes material from both .
the other form of lapping involves a softer material such as pitch or a ceramic for the lap , which is `` charged '' with the abrasive .
the lap is then used to cut a harder material ??? the workpiece .
the abrasive embeds within the softer material which holds it and permits it to score across and cut the harder material .
taken to a finer limit , this will produce a polished surface such as with a polishing cloth on an automobile , or a polishing cloth or polishing pitch upon glass or steel .
taken to the ultimate limit , with the aid of accurate interferometry and specialized polishing machines or skilled hand polishing , lensmakers can produce surfaces that are flat to better than 30 nanometers .
this is one twentieth of the wavelength of light from the commonly used 632.8 nm helium neon laser light source .
surfaces this flat can be molecularly bonded optically contacted by bringing them together under the right conditions .

the seven si base units and the interdependency of their definitions : for example , to extract the definition of the metre from the speed of light , the definition of the second must be known while the ampere and
the international system of units si defines seven units of measure as a basic set from which all other si units are derived .
these si base units and their physical quantities are :
metre for length us english : meter
kilogram for mass note : not the gram
second for time
ampere for electric current
kelvin for temperature
candela for luminous intensity
mole for the amount of substance .
the si base quantities form a set of mutually independent dimensions as required by dimensional analysis commonly employed in science and technology .
however , in a given realization of these units they may well be interdependent , i.e. defined in terms of each other .
the names of si units are written in lowercase characters the ` degree celsius ' meets this rule , as ` degree ' is the unit , and ` celsius ' is a modifier .
the symbols of units are written in lowercase e.g. metre has the symbol m , except that symbols for units named after persons are written with an initial capital letter e.g. , the hertz has the uppercase
many other units , such as the litre us english : liter , are formally not part of the si , but are accepted for use with si .

the september 11 attacks also referred to as september 11 , september 11th , or 9\/11 were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks launched by the islamic terrorist group al-qaeda upon the united states in new york
four passenger airliners were hijacked by 19 al-qaeda terrorists so they could be flown into buildings in suicide attacks .
two of those planes , american airlines flight 11 and united airlines flight 175 , were crashed into the north and south towers , respectively , of the world trade center complex in new york city .
within two hours , both towers collapsed with debris and the resulting fires causing partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the wtc complex , as well as major damage to ten other large surrounding structures .
a third plane , american airlines flight 77 , was crashed into the pentagon the headquarters of the united states department of defense , leading to a partial collapse in its western side .
the fourth plane , united airlines flight 93 , was targeted at the united states capitol in washington , d.c. , but crashed into a field near shanksville , pennsylvania , after its passengers tried to overcome the hijackers .
in total , almost 3,000 people died in the attacks , including the 227 civilians and 19 hijackers aboard the four planes .
suspicion quickly fell on al-qaeda .
although the group 's leader , osama bin laden , initially denied any involvement , in 2004 he claimed responsibility for the attacks .
al-qaeda and bin laden cited u.s. support of israel , the presence of u.s. troops in saudi arabia , and sanctions against iraq as motives for the attacks .
the united states responded to the attacks by launching the war on terror and invading afghanistan to depose the taliban , which had harbored al-qaeda .
many countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded law enforcement powers .
having evaded capture for years , bin laden was located and killed by u.s. forces in may 2011 .
the destruction of the twin towers and other properties caused serious damage to the economy of lower manhattan and had a significant effect on global markets .
cleanup of the world trade center site was completed in may 2002 , and the pentagon was repaired within a year .
numerous memorials have been constructed , including the national september 11 memorial & museum in new york , the pentagon memorial , and the flight 93 national memorial in pennsylvania .
after a lengthy delay , the one world trade center is expected to be completed at ground zero in new york city in 2013 .

charles john huffam dickens ; 7 february 1812 ??? 9 june 1870 was an english writer and social critic .
he created some of the world 's most memorable fictional characters and is generally regarded as the greatest novelist of the victorian period .
during his life , his works enjoyed unprecedented fame , and by the twentieth century his literary genius was broadly acknowledged by critics and scholars .
his novels and short stories continue to be widely popular .
born in portsmouth , england , dickens left school to work in a factory after his father was thrown into debtors ' prison .

his novels , most published in monthly or weekly instalments , pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction , which became the dominant victorian mode for novel publication .
the instalment format allowed dickens to evaluate his audience 's reaction , and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback .
for example , when his wife 's chiropodist expressed distress at the way miss mowcher in david copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities , dickens went on to improve the character with positive lineaments .
fagin in oliver twist apparently mirrors the famous fence ikey solomon ; his caricature of leigh hunt in the figure of mr skimpole in bleak house was likewise toned down on advice from some of his friends , as they

dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age .
his 1843 novella , a christmas carol , is one of the most influential works ever written , and it remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre .
his creative genius has been praised by fellow writers ??? from leo tolstoy to g. k. chesterton and george orwell ??? for its realism , comedy , prose style , unique characterisations , and social criticism .

the civil rights movement was a series of worldwide political movements for equality before the law that peaked in the 1960s .
in many situations it took the form of campaigns of civil resistance aimed at achieving change by nonviolent forms of resistance .
in some situations it was accompanied , or followed , by civil unrest and armed rebellion .
the process was long and tenuous in many countries , and many of these movements did not fully achieve their goals although , the efforts of these movements did lead to improvements in the legal rights of previously oppressed groups
the main aim of the civil rights movement included , and include , ensuring that the rights of all people are equally protected by the law , including the rights of minorities .
civil rights movements ranging from the global lgbt rights movement to the global women 's rights movement to various racial minority rights movements around the world continue .

the united states presidential election of 1968 was the 46th quadrennial presidential election , held on tuesday , november 5 , 1968 .
the republican nominee , former vice-president richard nixon , won the election over the democratic nominee , incumbent vice-president hubert humphrey .
nixon ran on a campaign that promised to restore law and order to the nation 's cities , torn by riots and crime .
analysts have argued the election of 1968 is a realigning election as it permanently disrupted the new deal coalition that had dominated presidential politics for 36 years .
coming four years after democrat lyndon b. johnson won in a historic landslide , the election saw the incumbent president forced out of the race and a republican elected for the first time in twelve years .
it was a wrenching national experience , conducted during a year of violence that included the assassination of civil rights leader martin luther king , jr. , and subsequent race riots across the nation , the assasination of democratic presidential
the election featured the strongest third party effort since 1912 by former alabama governor george wallace , a democrat .
because wallace 's campaign opposed federal intervention in the south to end school segregation , he carried the deep south and ran well in ethnic industrial districts in the north .
this was the last election in which new york had the most votes in the electoral college 43 votes .
after the 1970 census , california gained the most electoral votes and has remained the most populous state since then .
this is the latest election where a presidential ticket won without carrying the vice presidential candidate 's home state .

the agent is paid a percentage of the star 's earnings typically 10 % .
agents sometimes will be referred to as `` 10 percenters . ''
there are different regulations that govern different types of agents that are established by artist 's unions and the legal jurisdiction in which the agent operates .
there are also professional organizations that license talent agencies .
since the decline in viewership in theaters , from the 1950s to 1960s , this caused a monumental shift in how studios would produce films and thus reducing the cost of exclusive and expensive actors .
actors and actresses were working for the studios but were not owned by one major studio entity and so were able to work on within their time and with other studios .
because of this , agents were now seen as a necessity instead of an option .
agents now became third parties that negotiated between studios and clients , this making their services imperative between each party .
since talent agencies are working with lucrative contracts , all talent agencies must be licensed under special sections of the california labor code , which calls an agent a `` person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring

a dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that is neither a planet nor a satellite .
more explicitly , the international astronomical union iau defines a dwarf planet as a celestial body in direct orbit of the sun that is massive enough for its shape to be controlled by gravitation , but that unlike
the term dwarf planet was adopted in 2006 as part of a three-way categorization of bodies orbiting the sun , brought about by an increase in discoveries of trans-neptunian objects that rivaled pluto in size , and finally precipitated by
this classification states that bodies large enough to have cleared the neighborhood of their orbit are defined as planets , while those that are not massive enough to be rounded by their own gravity are defined as small solar system
dwarf planets come in between .
the exclusion of dwarf planets from the roster of planets by the iau has been both praised and criticized ; it was said to be the `` right decision '' by mike brown , who discovered and other new dwarf
the iau currently recognizes five dwarf planets in the solar system : , pluto , , , and .
however , only two of these bodies , ceres and pluto , have been observed in enough detail to demonstrate that they fit the definition .
eris has been accepted as a dwarf planet because it is more massive than pluto .
the iau subsequently decided that unnamed trans-neptunian objects with an absolute magnitude brighter than +1 and hence a diameter of ??? 838 km assuming a geometric albedo of ??? 1 are to be named under the assumption that
the only two such objects known at the time , makemake and haumea , went through this naming procedure and were declared to be dwarf planets .
it is suspected that another hundred or so known objects in the solar system are dwarf planets .
estimates are that up to 200 dwarf planets may be found when the entire region known as the kuiper belt is explored , and that the number may exceed 10,000 when objects scattered outside the kuiper belt are considered .
individual astronomers recognize several of these , and in august 2011 mike brown published a list of 390 candidate objects , ranging from `` nearly certain '' to `` possible '' dwarf planets . '
brown identifies nine known objects ??? the five accepted by the iau plus , , , and ??? as `` virtually certain '' , with another two dozen highly likely , and there are probably a hundred or so such
the classification of bodies in other planetary systems with the characteristics of dwarf planets has not been addressed .

west of the rockies , the route of i-70 was derived from multiple sources .
i-70 is the fifth longest interstate highway , after i-90 , i-80 , i-40 , and i-10 .
the construction of i-70 in colorado and utah is considered an engineering marvel as the route passes through the eisenhower tunnel , glenwood canyon , and the san rafael swell .
the eisenhower tunnel is the highest point along the interstate highway system with an elevation of .
the sections of the interstate in missouri and kansas have laid claim to be the first interstate in the united states .

photo of 1999 total eclipse
as seen from the earth , a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and earth , and the moon fully or partially blocks '' occults '' the sun .
this can happen only at new moon , when the sun and the moon are in conjunction as seen from earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy .
in a total eclipse , the disk of the sun is fully obscured by the moon .
in partial and annular eclipses only part of the sun is obscured .
if the moon were in a perfectly circular orbit , a little closer to the earth , and in the same orbital plane , there would be total solar eclipses every single month .
however , the moon 's orbit is inclined tilted at more than 5 degrees to earth 's orbit around the sun see ecliptic so its shadow at new moon usually misses earth .
earth 's orbit is called the ecliptic plane as the moon 's orbit must cross this plane in order for an eclipse both solar as well as lunar to occur .
in addition , the moon 's actual orbit is elliptical , often taking it far enough away from earth that its apparent size is not large enough to block the sun totally .
the orbital planes cross each year at a line of nodes resulting in at least two , and up to five , solar eclipses occurring each year ; no more than two of which can be total eclipses .
however , total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on earth 's surface traced by the moon 's shadow or umbra .
an eclipse is a natural phenomenon .
nevertheless , in some ancient and modern cultures , solar eclipses have been attributed to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens .
a total solar eclipse can be frightening to people who are unaware of its astronomical explanation , as the sun seems to disappear during the day and the sky darkens in a matter of minutes .
because it is dangerous to look directly at the sun , observers should use special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques when viewing a partial eclipse , or the partial phases of a total eclipse .
it is safe to view the total phase of a total solar eclipse with the unaided eye and without protection , however .
people referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will travel to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses .
the mango is a fleshy stone fruit belonging to the genus mangifera , consisting of numerous tropical fruiting trees in the flowering plant family anacardiaceae .
the mango is native to south asia , from where it has been distributed worldwide to become one of the most cultivated fruits in the tropics .
while other mangifera species e.g. horse mango , m. foetida are also grown on a more localized basis , mangifera indica ??? the ` common mango ' or ` indian mango ' ??? is the only mango tree
it is the national fruit of india , pakistan and philippines .
in several cultures , its fruit and leaves are ritually used as floral decorations at weddings , public celebrations and religious ceremonies .
world map showing the tropic of cancer
the tropic of cancer , also referred to as the northern tropic , is the circle of latitude on the earth that marks the most northerly position at which the sun may appear directly overhead at its zenith .
this event occurs once per year , at the time of the june solstice , when the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun to its maximum extent .
it currently year 2013 lies at 23 ?? 26 ??? 15.143 ?????? north of the equator .
its southern hemisphere counterpart , marking the most southerly position at which the sun may appear directly overhead , is the tropic of capricorn .
these tropics are two of the five major degree measures or major circles of latitude that mark maps of the earth , besides the arctic and antarctic circles and the equator .
the positions of these circles of latitude other than the equator are dictated by the tilt of the earth 's axis of rotation relative to the plane of its orbit .

princess cut diamond set in a ring
the princess cut is the second most popular cut shape for diamonds , next to a round brilliant .
the face-up shape of the princess cut is square or rectangular and the profile or side-on shape is similar to that of an inverted pyramid with four beveled sides .
the princess cut is a relatively new diamond cut , having been created in the 1960s .
it has gained in popularity in recent years as a more distinctive alternative to the more popular round brilliant cut , in which the top of diamond , called the crown , is cut with a round face-up shape and
a princess cut with the same width as the diameter of a round brilliant will weigh more as it has four corners which would otherwise have been cut off and rounded to form a round brilliant .
the princess cut is sometimes referred to as a square modified brilliant .
however , while displaying the same high degree of brilliance , its faceting style is unique and completely different from that of a round brilliant .
the princess cut had its origins in the early `` french '' cut , having a step-modified `` double-french '' or `` cross '' cut crown and a series of unique , chevron-shaped facets in the pavilion which combine to
effectively , the princess cut combines the high degree of light return of a round brilliant cut with a distinctive square or rectangular shape .
the square princess cut diamond is usually slightly cheaper than round brilliant cut diamonds of the same carat weight because it retains about 80 % of the rough diamond , as opposed to the round brilliant which retains only about
the ability to retain more crystal weight makes this shape popular amongst diamond cutters .
accredited gem appraisers aga and american gem society laboratory agsl and european gem laboratories-usa egl-usa are currently the only labs that grade the princess cut for cut .
there is no universal definition of what measurements make an ideal princess cut diamond and many diamond manufacturers market ideal diamonds with differing facet patterns and angles as `` ideal cut '' .
in contrast to the agsl , aga , and egl-usa the gemological institute of america gia has stated that there is not enough industry consensus or empirical data to specify cut grading standards for princess cut diamonds and
the name `` princess cut '' was originally used in connection with another diamond cut , otherwise known as the `` profile '' cut , designed by arpad nagy , a london cutter , in 1961 .
the same name was later used and made popular by ygal perlman , betzalel ambar , and israel itzkowitz in israel in 1979 .
a similar cut with only 49 facets , as opposed to the original 58 facets of the princess cut , was later branded the `` quadrillion '' and initially distributed by ambar diamonds in los angeles .
three years of optical research yielded a square stone with faceting similar to that of a round brilliant cut diamond .
a comparison
the number of chevrons can affect the overall outlook of a princess cut diamond .
this can usually be determined by the wire diagram that is plotted in diamond grading reports .
by adding more chevrons on the pavilion side of the diamond , the individual facets of the diamond will now be broken down into smaller facets .
as a result , it can give a princess cut diamond a `` crushed ice '' look .
vice versa , when a princess cut diamond has lesser chevrons , it tends to give the diamond a chunky outlook due to broader facets .
the domestic dog canis lupus familiaris is a subspecies of the gray wolf canis lupus , a member of the canidae family of the mammalian order carnivora .
the term `` domestic dog '' is generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties .
the dog has been the first animal to be domesticated and has been the most widely kept working , hunting , and pet animal in human history .
the word `` dog '' may also mean the male of a canine species , as opposed to the word `` bitch '' for the female of the species .
mtdna evidence shows an evolutionary split between the modern dog 's lineage and the modern wolf 's lineage around 100,000 years ago but , , the oldest fossil specimens genetically linked to the modern dog 's lineage date to approximately
dogs ' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures .
dogs perform many roles for people , such as hunting , herding , pulling loads , protection , assisting police and military , companionship , and , more recently , aiding handicapped individuals .
this impact on human society has given them the nickname `` man 's best friend '' in the western world .
in some cultures , dogs are also a source of meat .
in 2001 , there were estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world .
most breeds of dogs are at most a few hundred years old , having been artificially selected for particular morphologies and behaviors by people for specific functional roles .
through this selective breeding , the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds , and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal .
for example , height measured to the withers ranges from in the chihuahua to about in the irish wolfhound ; color varies from white through grays usually called `` blue '' to black , and browns from light
it is common for most breeds to shed this coat .

among the delegates to the convention were future us presidents thomas jefferson and george washington .
theodore `` t.r. ''
roosevelt , jr. ; october 27 , 1858 ??? january 6 , 1919 was the 26th president of the united states 1901 ??? 1909 .
he is noted for his exuberant personality , range of interests and achievements , and his leadership of the progressive movement , as well as his '' cowboy '' persona and robust masculinity .
he was a leader of the republican party and founder of the first incarnation of the short-lived progressive `` bull moose '' party of 1912 .
before becoming president , he held offices at the city , state , and federal levels .
roosevelt 's achievements as a naturalist , explorer , hunter , author , and soldier are as much a part of his fame as any office he held as a politician .
roosevelt was 42 years old when sworn in as president of the united states in 1901 , making him the youngest president ever ; he beat out the youngest elected president , john f. kennedy , by only one year
roosevelt was also the first of only three sitting presidents to have won the nobel peace prize .
the teddy bear is named after him , despite his contempt for being called `` teddy '' .
born into a wealthy family in new york city , roosevelt was a sickly child who suffered from asthma and stayed at home studying natural history .
to overcome his physical weakness , he embraced a strenuous life .
home-schooled , he became an eager student of nature .
he attended harvard university , where he studied biology , boxed and developed an interest in naval affairs .
in 1881 , one year out of harvard , he was elected to the new york state assembly , where he became a leader of the reform faction of his republican party the `` gop '' .
his the naval war of 1812 1882 established his professional reputation as a serious historian ; he wrote numerous books on hunting , the outdoors , and current political issues , as well as frontier history .
in 1884 , his first wife and his mother died on the same day .
he temporarily left politics and went to the frontier , becoming a rancher in the `` badlands '' in the dakotas .
returning to new york city , he ran for mayor in 1886 , finishing third with 60,000 votes .
he later gained fame by taking vigorous charge of the city police .
at the national level , he was a leader in civil service reform .
the spanish ??? american war broke out in 1898 while roosevelt was , effectively , running the department of the navy .
he promptly resigned and formed the rough riders ??? a volunteer cavalry regiment that fought in cuba .
the war hero was elected governor in 1898 and in 1900 was nominated for vice president .
he successfully energized the gop base as a highly visible campaigner to reelect president william mckinley on a platform of high tariffs , the gold standard , imperialism , prosperity at home and victory abroad .
in 1901 , president william mckinley was assassinated and roosevelt became president .
he attempted to move the republican party gop toward progressivism , including trust busting and increased regulation of businesses .
roosevelt became the first person elected to a term in his own right in 1904 after having ascended to the presidency from the vice-presidency upon the death of his predecessor , winning the largest percentage of the popular
roosevelt coined the phrase '' square deal '' to describe his domestic agenda , emphasizing that the average citizen would get a fair share under his policies .
as an outdoorsman and naturalist , he promoted the conservation movement .
on the world stage , roosevelt 's policies were characterized by his slogan , '' speak softly and carry a big stick '' .
webster is an american situation comedy that aired on abc from september 16 , 1983 until may 8 , 1987 , and in first-run syndication from september 21 , 1987 until march 10 , 1989 .
the series was created by stu silver .
the show stars emmanuel lewis in the title role as a young boy who , after losing his parents , is adopted by his nfl - pro godfather , portrayed by alex karras , and his new socialite wife ,
the focus was largely on how this impulsively married couple had to adjust to their new lives and sudden parenthood , but it was the congenial webster himself who drove much of the plot .
the series was produced by georgian bay ltd. , emmanuel lewis entertainment enterprises , inc. 1986-1989 and paramount television .
like nbc 's earlier hit diff ` rent strokes , webster featured a young african-american boy adopted by a white family .
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis adem is an immune mediated disease of the brain .
it usually occurs following a viral infection but may appear following vaccination , bacterial or parasitic infection , or even appear spontaneously .
as it involves autoimmune demyelination , it is similar to multiple sclerosis , and is considered part of the multiple sclerosis borderline diseases .
the incidence rate is about 8 per 1,000,000 people per year .
although it occurs in all ages , most reported cases are in children and adolescents , with the average age around 5 to 8 years old .
the mortality rate may be as high as 5 % , full recovery is seen in 50 to 75 % of cases , while up to 70 to 90 % recover with some minor residual disability .
the average time to recover is one to six months .
adem produces multiple inflammatory lesions in the brain and spinal cord , particularly in the white matter .
usually these are found in the subcortical and central white matter and cortical gray-white junction of both cerebral hemispheres , cerebellum , brainstem , and spinal cord , but periventricular white matter and gray matter of the cortex , thalami
when the patient suffers more than one demyelinating episode , it is called recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis mdem .
bing known previously as live search , windows live search , and msn search is a web search engine advertised as a '' decision engine '' from microsoft .
bing was unveiled by microsoft ceo steve ballmer on may 28 , 2009 at the all things digital conference in san diego for release on june 1 .
notable changes include the listing of search suggestions while queries are entered and a list of related searches called `` explore pane '' based on semantic technology from powerset which microsoft purchased in 2008 .

all yahoo ! search global customers and partners are expected to have made the transition by early 2012 .
in october 2011 , bing announced it was working on new back-end search infrastructure , with the goal of delivering faster and slightly more relevant search results for users .
known as `` tiger '' , the new index-serving technology has been incorporated into bing globally , since august 2011 .
in may 2012 , bing announced another redesign of its search engine that includes `` sidebar '' , a social feature that searches users ' social networks for information relevant to the search query .
the hubble space telescope hst is a space telescope that was carried into orbit by a space shuttle in 1990 and remains in operation .
a aperture telescope in low earth orbit , hubble 's four main instruments observe in the near ultraviolet , visible , and near infrared .
the telescope is named after the astronomer edwin hubble .
hubble 's orbit outside the distortion of earth 's atmosphere allows it to take extremely sharp images with almost no background light .
hubble 's deep field have been some of the most detailed visible-light images ever , allowing a deep view into space and time .
many hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics , such as accurately determining the rate of expansion of the universe .
although not the first space telescope , hubble is one of the largest and most versatile , and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy .
the hst was built by the united states space agency nasa , with contributions from the european space agency , and is operated by the space telescope science institute .
the hst is one of nasa 's great observatories , along with the compton gamma ray observatory , the chandra x-ray observatory , and the spitzer space telescope .
space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923 .
hubble was funded in the 1970s , with a proposed launch in 1983 , but the project was beset by technical delays , budget problems , and the challenger disaster .
when finally launched in 1990 , scientists found that the main mirror had been ground incorrectly , compromising the telescope 's capabilities .
the telescope was restored to its intended quality by a servicing mission in 1993 .
hubble is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by astronauts .
between 1993 and 2002 , four missions repaired , upgraded , and replaced systems on the telescope ; a fifth mission was canceled on safety grounds following the columbia disaster .
however , after spirited public discussion , nasa administrator mike griffin approved one final servicing mission , completed in 2009 by space shuttle atlantis .
the telescope is now expected to function until at least 2013 .
its scientific successor , the james webb space telescope jwst , is to be launched in 2018 or possibly later .
anti-inflammatory refers to the property of a substance or treatment that reduces inflammation .
anti-inflammatory drugs make up about half of analgesics , remedying pain by reducing inflammation as opposed to opioids , which affect the central nervous system .
ss andrea doria .
pronounced was an ocean liner for the italian line societ ?? di navigazione italia home ported in genoa , italy , most famous for its sinking in 1956 , when 52 people died 51 from immediate impact
named after the 16th-century genoese admiral andrea doria , the ship had a gross register tonnage of 29,100 and a capacity of about 1,200 passengers and 500 crew .
for a country attempting to rebuild its economy and reputation after world war ii , andrea doria was an icon of italian national pride .
of all italy 's ships at the time , andrea doria was the largest , fastest and supposedly safest .
launched on 16 june 1951 , the ship undertook its maiden voyage on 14 january 1953 .
on 25 july 1956 , while the andrea doria was approaching the coast of nantucket , massachusetts , bound for new york city , the eastbound of the swedish american line collided with it in what became one of history
struck in the side , the top-heavy andrea doria immediately started to list severely to starboard , which left half of its lifeboats unusable .
the consequent shortage of lifeboats might have resulted in significant loss of life , but the efficiency of the ship 's technical design allowed it to stay afloat for over 11 hours after the ramming .
the good behavior of the crew , improvements in communications and the rapid response of other ships averted a disaster similar in scale to that of the in 1912 .
1,660 passengers and crew were rescued and survived , while 46 people died as a consequence of the collision .
the evacuated luxury liner capsized and sank the following morning .
this accident remains the worst maritime disaster to occur in united states waters since the sinking of the in 1915 .
the incident and its aftermath were heavily covered by the news media .
while the rescue efforts were both successful and commendable , the cause of the collision with the stockholm and the loss of andrea doria generated much interest in the media and many lawsuits .
largely because of an out-of-court settlement agreement between the two shipping companies during hearings immediately after the disaster , no determination of the cause s was ever formally published .
although greater blame appeared initially to fall on the italian liner , more recent discoveries have indicated that a misreading of radar on the swedish ship may have initiated the collision course , leading to errors on both ships .
andrea doria was the last major transatlantic passenger vessel to sink before aircraft became the preferred method of travel .
dialysis tubing
dialysis tubing is a type of semi - or partially permeable membrane tubing made from regenerated cellulose or cellophane .
it can be used for diffusion with solutes or osmosis if used with water only .
osmosis is when water passes through a semi-permeable layer to reach equilibrium .
diffusion , on the other hand , allows the movement of molecules from high concentration to low concentration .
it will only allow molecules to pass through a semi-permeable membrane or layer if the molecule is small enough to fit through the membrane or a membrane 's pore .
this usually results with the effects of diffusion through a membrane only really affects small molecules , and almost never larger molecules .
dialysis tubing is used in clinical circumstances to ensure a filtered flow of molecules , preventing the flow of larger solute molecules .
small molecules can be `` washed '' out of a solution which is pumped through the tubing into a solvent , usually water , which surrounds it and in which they can be flushed away .
in demonstrations of semi-permeable membranes , a solution containing several types of molecules , usually glucose and starch , is placed into a semi-permeable dialysis bag , such as a cellulose membrane with pores , and the bag is sealed
the sealed dialysis bag is placed in a container of a different solution , or water .
molecules small enough to pass through the tubing water , salts , monosaccharides , and other small molecules tend to move into or out of the dialysis bag in the direction of decreasing concentration , therefore displaying diffusion
larger molecules such as proteins , or polysaccharides that have dimensions significantly greater than the pore diameter are retained inside the dialysis bag .
the water and smaller solutes in a hypotonic solution a solution that has a lesser solute concentration than the solution it is referenced to will cross a semi-permeable membrane , like dialysis tubing , into a hypertonic solution
four thirds logo
the four thirds system is a standard created by olympus and kodak for digital single-lens reflex camera dslr design and development . <ref name='dpreview.com 2001-02-13'>
the system provides a standard that , with digital cameras and lenses available from multiple manufacturers , allows for the interchange of lenses and bodies from different manufacturers .
seems to cover the standard .
proponents describe it as an open standard , but companies may only use it under a non-disclosure agreement .
unlike older slr systems , four thirds has been designed from the ground up to be entirely digital .
many lenses are extensively computerized , to the point that olympus offers firmware updates for many of them .
lens design has been tailored to the requirements of digital sensors , most notably through telecentric designs .
the size of the sensor is significantly smaller than for most dslrs and this implies that lenses , especially telephoto lenses , can be smaller .
for example , a four thirds lens with a 300 mm focal length would cover about the same angle of view as a 600 mm focal length lens for the 35 mm film standard , and is correspondingly more compact
thus , the four thirds system has crop factor focal length multiplier of about 2 , and while this enables longer focal length for greater magnification , it does n't aid the manufacture of wide angle lenses .
the image sensor format , generally intermediate between those of larger slrs and smaller compact cameras , generally gives levels of cost , performance and convenience intermediate between those two classes .
`` nature boy '' is a song by eden ahbez , published in 1947 .
the song tells a fantasy of a `` strange enchanted boy ... who wandered very far '' only to learn that `` the greatest thing ... was just to love and be loved in return '' .
nat king cole 's 1948 recording of the song was a major hit and `` nature boy '' has since become a pop and jazz standard , with dozens of major artists interpreting the song .
the launch of the playstation 3 into the japanese market on 10 november 2006 marked the second major seventh generation entertainment system to be released .
the system was released seven days later on 17 november in the united states .
introduction into other world markets was delayed by a shortage of diodes for use in the blu-ray disc player ; the device was launched in european and other world markets in the first half of 2007 .
black pepper piper nigrum is a flowering vine in the family piperaceae , cultivated for its fruit , which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning .
the fruit , known as a peppercorn when dried , is approximately in diameter , dark red when fully mature , and , like all drupes , contains a single seed .
peppercorns , and the ground pepper derived from them , may be described simply as pepper , or more precisely as black pepper cooked and dried unripe fruit , green pepper dried unripe fruit and white
black pepper is native to south india , and is extensively cultivated there and elsewhere in tropical regions .
currently vietnam is the world 's largest producer and exporter of pepper , producing 34 % of the world 's piper nigrum crop as of 2008 .
dried ground pepper has been used since antiquity for both its flavor and as a medicine .
black pepper is the world 's most traded spice .
it is one of the most common spices added to european cuisine and its descendants .
the spiciness of black pepper is due to the chemical piperine , not to be confused with the capsaicin that gives fleshy peppers theirs .
it is in the modern world , often paired with salt .
`` cocaine '' is a song written and recorded by jj cale in 1976 , but also known as a cover version recorded by eric clapton .
allmusic calls the latter `` among clapton 's most enduringly popular hits '' and notes that `` even for an artist like clapton with a huge body of high-quality work , ` cocaine ' ranks among his best
glyn johns , who had previously worked with the who , led zeppelin and the rolling stones , produced the clapton recording , which was released on clapton 's 1977 album slowhand and as a single in 1980 .
the live version of `` cocaine '' , from the just one night album recorded in tokyo , charted on the billboard hot 100 as the b-side of '' tulsa time '' , which was a no. 30 hit in
cocaine '' was one of several of cale 's songs recorded by clapton , including '' after midnight '' and `` travelin ' light '' .
the attack on pearl harbor called hawaii operation or operation ai by the japanese imperial general headquarters operation z in planning and the battle of pearl harbor was a surprise military strike conducted by the imperial
from the standpoint of the defenders , the attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. hawaiian time .
the attack was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the u.s. pacific fleet from interfering with military actions the empire of japan was planning in southeast asia against overseas territories of the united kingdom , the netherlands
the base was attacked by 353 japanese fighters , bombers and torpedo planes in two waves , launched from six aircraft carriers .
all eight u.s. navy battleships were damaged , with four being sunk .
two of these were later raised , and with the remaining four repaired , six battleships returned to service later in the war .
the japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers , three destroyers , an anti-aircraft training ship , and one minelayer .
188 u.s. aircraft were destroyed ; 2,402 americans were killed and 1,282 wounded .
important base installations such as the power station , shipyard , maintenance , and fuel and torpedo storage facilities , as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building also home of the intelligence section were not attacked
japanese losses were light : 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost , and 65 servicemen killed or wounded .
one japanese sailor was captured .
the attack came as a profound shock to the american people and led directly to the american entry into world war ii in both the pacific and european theaters .
the following day december 8 , the united states declared war on japan .
domestic support for non-interventionism , which had been strong , disappeared .
clandestine support of britain for example the neutrality patrol was replaced by active alliance .
subsequent operations by the u.s. prompted germany and italy to declare war on the u.s. on december 11 , which was reciprocated by the u.s. the same day .
there were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by japan .
however , the lack of any formal warning , particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing , led president franklin d. roosevelt to proclaim december 7 , 1941 , '' a date which will live in infamy '' .
project runway season 2 was the second season of bravo 's successful project runway , a reality competition for fashion designers .
season 2 began airing on december 7 , 2005 .
following a nationwide search earlier in the year , sixteen designers were chosen as semi-finalists and brought to new york city in june , 2005 .
after the first challenge , called `` road to the runway '' , fourteen went on to compete as finalists .
the winning designer , chloe dao , received $ 100,000 in seed money to help launch her own line , a 2007 saturn sky roadster , a spread in elle magazine , and a mentorship with the banana republic design
winning alongside dao was her model , grace kelsey , who received the elle magazine spread .
michael kors and nina garcia returned as judges for the second season .
the fourth judging seat rotated each week , based on the challenge .
tim gunn , fashion chair at parsons the new school for design , returned as a mentor for the designers .
kara janx later appeared in project runway : all stars in 2012 , where she finished 7th out of 13 .
andrae gonzalo , in the same year , competed in the second season of the all stars edition placing 10th out of 13 .
an example of a heraclius mule
in numismatics , a mule is a coin or medal minted with obverse and reverse designs not normally seen on the same piece .
these can be intentional or produced by error .
this type of error is highly sought after , and examples can fetch steep prices from collectors .
the earliest mules are found among ancient greek and roman coins .
opinion is divided between those who think that they are accidental , the result of an incorrect combination of a new die with one that had officially been withdrawn from use , or the work of coiners working with dies
the name derives from the mule , the hybrid offspring of a horse and a donkey , due to such a coin having two sides intended for different coins , much as a mule has parents of two different species
mary poppins is a 1964 musical film starring julie andrews , dick van dyke , david tomlinson , and glynis johns , produced by walt disney , and based on the mary poppins books series by p. l. travers .
the film was directed by robert stevenson and written by bill walsh and don dagradi , with songs by the sherman brothers .
it was shot at walt disney studios in burbank , california .
julie andrews won the academy award for best actress for her performance as mary poppins and the film also won oscars for best film editing , original music score , best song for `` chim chim cher-ee '' and best
a story arc is an extended or continuing storyline in episodic storytelling media such as television , comic books , comic strips , boardgames , video games , and in some cases , films .
on a television program , for example , the story would unfold over many episodes .
in television , the use of the story arc is much more common in dramas than in comedies , especially in soap operas .
webcomics are more likely to use story arcs than newspaper comics , as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on .
although story arcs have existed for decades , the term `` story arc '' was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series wiseguy , and was quickly adapted for other uses .
many american comic book series are now written in four or six-issue arcs , within a continuing series .
short story arcs are easier to package as trade paperbacks for resale , and more accessible to the casual reader than the never-ending continuity that once characterised comics .
black friday is the day following thanksgiving day in the united states , often regarded as the beginning of the christmas shopping season .
in recent years , most major retailers have opened extremely early and offered promotional sales to kick off the holiday shopping season , similar to boxing day sales in many commonwealth nations .
black friday is not an official public holiday as such , but many non-retail employees and schools have both thanksgiving and the day after off , followed by a weekend , thereby increasing the number of potential shoppers .
it has routinely been the busiest shopping day of the year since 2005 , although news reports , which at that time were inaccurate , have described it as the busiest shopping day of the year for a much longer
the day 's name originated in philadelphia , where it originally was used to describe the heavy and disruptive pedestrian and vehicle traffic which would occur on the day after thanksgiving .
use of the term started before 1961 and began to see broader use outside philadelphia around 1975 .
later an alternative explanation began to be offered : that `` black friday '' indicates the point at which retailers begin to turn a profit , or are '' '' .
for many years , it was common for retailers to open at 6:00 a.m. , but in the late 2000s many had crept to 5:00 or even 4:00 .
this was taken to a new extreme in 2011 , when several retailers including target , kohl 's , macy 's , best buy , and bealls opened at midnight for the first time .
in 2012 , walmart and several other retailers announced that they would open most of their stores at 8:00 p.m. on thanksgiving day except in states where opening on thanksgiving is prohibited due to blue laws , such as
black friday shopping is known for attracting aggressive crowds , with annual reports of assaults , shootings , and throngs of people trampling on other shoppers in an attempt to get the best deal on a product before supplies run
`` what a wonderful world '' is a song written by bob thiele as `` george douglas '' and george david weiss .
it was first recorded by louis armstrong and released as a single in 1967 .
thiele and weiss were both prominent in the music world thiele as a producer and weiss as a composer\/performer .
armstrong 's recording was inducted in the grammy hall of fame in 1999 .
the publishing for this song is controlled by memory lane music group , carlin music corp. , and bug music , inc. .

the inauguration of the president of the united states is a ceremonial event marking the commencement of a new four-year term of a president of the united states .
the day a presidential inauguration occurs is known as `` inauguration day '' and occurs on january 20 or 21st if the 20th is a sunday .
-lrb- prior to the twentieth amendment , the date was march 4 , the day of the year on which the constitution of the united states first took effect in 1789 ; the last inauguration to take place on the
the most recent public presidential inauguration ceremony , the swearing in of president barack obama to begin his second four-year term in office , took place on monday , january 21 , 2013 .
the only inauguration element mandated by the united states constitution is that the president make an oath or affirmation before that person can `` enter on the execution '' of the office of the presidency .
however , over the years , various traditions have arisen that have expanded the inauguration from a simple oath-taking ceremony to a day-long event , including parades , speeches , and balls .
from the presidency of andrew jackson through that of jimmy carter , the primary inauguration day ceremony took place on the capitol 's east portico .
since the 1981 inauguration of ronald reagan , the ceremony has been held at the capitol 's west front .
the inaugurations of william howard taft in 1909 and reagan in 1985 were moved indoors at the capitol due to cold weather .
the war of 1812 and world war ii caused two inaugurations to be held at other locations in washington , d.c.
when george washington was inaugurated , the oath was administered by robert livingston , chancellor of new york state , in 1789 , and by william cushing , associate justice of the supreme court , in 1793 .
since chief justice oliver ellsworth swore in president john adams , no chief justice has missed an inauguration day .
when inauguration day has fallen on a sunday , the chief justice has administered the oath to the president on the sunday privately and then again the next day publicly .
when a new president takes over mid-term due to the death or resignation of a president , the oath of office is administered but formal , public inauguration events have not been held .
elizabeth cady stanton and her daughter , harriot
elizabeth cady stanton november 12 , 1815 ??? october 26 , 1902 was an american social activist , abolitionist , and leading figure of the early women 's rights movement .
her declaration of sentiments , presented at the first women 's rights convention held in 1848 in seneca falls , new york , is often credited with initiating the first organized women 's rights and women 's suffrage movements in
before stanton narrowed her political focus almost exclusively to women 's rights , she was an active abolitionist together with her husband , henry brewster stanton and cousin , gerrit smith .
unlike many of those involved in the women 's rights movement , stanton addressed various issues pertaining to women beyond voting rights .
her concerns included women 's parental and custody rights , property rights , employment and income rights , divorce , the economic health of the family , and birth control .
she was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th-century temperance movement .
after the american civil war , stanton 's commitment to female suffrage caused a schism in the women 's rights movement when she , together with susan b. anthony , declined to support passage of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments
she opposed giving added legal protection and voting rights to african american men while women , black and white , were denied those same rights .
her position on this issue , together with her thoughts on organized christianity and women 's issues beyond voting rights , led to the formation of two separate women 's rights organizations that were finally rejoined , with stanton as
stanton died in 1902 having authored both the woman 's bible and her autobiography , along with many articles and pamphlets concerning female suffrage and women 's rights .

club level seating is a special section of seating in modern sports stadiums .
the club level is usually located towards the middle of the stage of seating sections , above the lower deck but below the upper deck .
they are usually right next to the luxury boxes , either right above , right below , or sandwiched between two levels of luxury boxes .
club level seating is considered as higher class than sitting anywhere else in the arena , but lower class compared to the luxury boxes .
unlike the luxury boxes , most club levels do not wrap entirely around the arena .
some club levels stop at a certain point , giving way to an expansion of the mezzanine , while others give way to lower class luxury boxes such as `` party suites '' .
a notable exception to this is emirates stadium in london , which has a complete tier of club seating .
club levels allow fans multiple levels of entertainment .
club level seating is open to the elements , as opposed to the entirely enclosed luxury boxes , which gives more of an outdoors impression at roofless and open-roof stadiums and arenas .
club level seating is normally bought on a contract basis to allow for maximum profit on the part of the stadium .
the club level provides fans with special access to an indoor part of the arena exclusive to fans with special tickets .
these areas are air conditioned and allow access to special restaurants , merchandise stands , and lounge areas of the stadium that are not otherwise available .
concession stands and vendors on the club level also often offer different menus than in other stands to give more of a special feel to the club .
these areas are closed off to the rest of the stadium , and they usually can only be accessed through the exclusive , private club entrances .

in chemistry , a disulfide bond br . e. disulphide bond is a covalent bond , usually derived by the coupling of two thiol groups .
the linkage is also called an ss-bond or disulfide bridge .
the overall connectivity is therefore r-s-s-r .
the terminology is widely used in biochemistry .
in formal terms , the connection is a persulfide , in analogy to its congener , peroxide r-o-o-r , but this terminology is obscure and is no longer used except in reference to r-s-s-h or h-s-s-h compounds

in united states college athletics , redshirt is a delay or suspension of an athlete 's participation in order to lengthen his or her period of eligibility .
typically , a student 's athletic eligibility in a given sport is four seasons , a number derived from the four years of academic classes that are normally required to obtain a bachelor 's degree at an american college or
however , a student athlete may be offered the opportunity to redshirt for up to two years , which allows the athlete to spread those four years of eligibility over five , or sometimes six years .
in a redshirt year , a student athlete may attend classes at the college or university , practice with an athletic team , and dress for play but he or she may not compete during the game .
using this mechanism , a student athlete has up to five academic years to use the four years of eligibility , thus becoming a fifth-year senior .
the term is used as a verb , noun , and adjective .
for example , a coach may choose to redshirt a player who is then referred to as a redshirt freshman or simply a redshirt .
the opposite of this is a `` true freshman . ''
map of countries that declared themselves to be socialist states under the marxist ??? leninist or maoist definition - that is to say , `` communist states '' - between 1979 and 1983 .
this period marked the greatest territorial extent of communist states .
a communist state is a state where the means of production are collectively owned by the society .
it has a form of government characterized by single-party rule or dominant-party rule of a communist party referred as dictatorship of the proletariat by its proponents and a professed allegiance to a leninist or marxist ??? leninist ideology
technically , `` communist state '' is a contradictio in terminis as a communist society as defined by both marxists and anarcho-communists is in principle stateless .
from this perspective , the term marxist-leninist state is more appropriate .
historically , a `` communist state '' referred to a system where public ownership of all or most means of production by the communist party - run state is deemed necessary to further the interests of the working class ;
according to marxist ??? leninists , the state is a tool in the hands of the ruling class , which in a socialist society is the working class , so a socialist state is , according to leninists , a
in practice , communist states do not actually refer to themselves as such .
they do this not to disguise the fact that the ruling party is communist , but rather because they do not consider themselves to be a communist society at present .
instead , they constitutionally identify themselves as socialist states or workers ' states .
the primary goal of these states , which also explains their official name , is to guide their respective countries in the process of building socialism , ultimately leading to communism .
communist states may have several legal political parties , but the communist party is usually granted a special or dominant role in government , often by statute or under the constitution .
consequently , the institutions of the state and of the communist party become intimately entwined , such as in the development of parallel institutions .
in the 20th century , most communist states adopted planned economies .
however , there were exceptions : the soviet union during the 1920s and late 1980s and yugoslavia after world war ii allowed limited markets and a degree of worker self-management , while china , vietnam and laos introduced far-reaching market
in the 21st century , china and vietnam have allowed a mixed economy to develop .
the fundamental concepts of communist states often diverge from the original socio-economic ideologies from which they develop .
as a result , many adherents of these ideologies often oppose the political systems commonly associated with these states .
for example , dissenting communists such as trotskyists were often opposed to the communist states of the 20th century , claiming either that they had nothing to do with `` real '' communism or that the ideology of such states
the south africa national rugby union team known as the springboks represents south africa in rugby union .
they compete in the annual rugby championship , along with southern-hemisphere counterparts argentina , australia and new zealand .
they have won this championship on three occasions in sixteen years .
they are currently ranked second in the world by the international rugby board , and were named 2008 world team of the year at the laureus world sports awards .
although south africa was instrumental in the creation of the rugby world cup competition , the springboks did not compete in the first two world cups in 1987 and 1991 because of anti-apartheid sporting boycotts of south africa .
the team made its world cup debut in 1995 , when the newly democratic south africa hosted the tournament .
the springboks then defeated the all blacks 15 ??? 12 in the final , which is now remembered as one of the greatest moments in south africa 's sporting history , and a watershed moment in the post-apartheid nation-building process
south africa regained their title as champions 12 years later , when they defeated england 15 ??? 6 in the 2007 final .
as a result of the 2007 world cup tournament the springboks were promoted to first place in the irb world rankings , a position they held until july the following year when new zealand regained the top spot .
the springboks play in green and gold jerseys , and their emblems are the springbok and the protea .
the side has been playing international rugby since 1891 , when a british isles side toured the nation , playing south africa in their first test on 30 july .
south africa was coached by jake white , who led the boks to the 2007 world cup title , announcing his resignation effectively from the end of 2007 .
his replacement 's peter de villiers contract expired in 2011 , following a 11 ??? 9 defeat to australia in the rugby world cup quarter-final , who then stated he would not be signing a new deal .
the previous captain was john smit , who before he retired in 2011 played hooker for most of his career , although he has also been a prop , mainly in 2008 and 2009 .
due to smit being unavailable for the november 2010 tests after surgery , lock victor matfield took smit 's place as captain for that tour .
the current captain is jean de villiers .
an academic discipline , or field of study , is a branch of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level .
disciplines are defined in part , and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published , and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong .
however , there exists no formal criteria for when educational programs and scholarly journals form an academic discipline .
a huge difference exists between , on the one hand , well established disciplines that exist in almost all universities all over the world , have a long history , and have a well established set of journals and conferences
fields of study usually have several sub-disciplines or branches , and the distinguishing lines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous .

kennedy defeated vice president and republican candidate richard nixon in the 1960 u.s. presidential election .
at 43 years of age , he is the youngest to have been elected to the office , the second-youngest president after theodore roosevelt , and the first person born in the 20th century to serve as president
a catholic , kennedy is the only non - protestant president , and is the only president to have won a pulitzer prize .
events during his presidency included the bay of pigs invasion , the cuban missile crisis , the building of the berlin wall , the space race , the african-american civil rights movement , and early stages of the vietnam war
therein , kennedy increased the number of military advisers , special operation forces , and helicopters in an effort to curb the spread of communism in south east asia .
the kennedy administration adopted the policy of the strategic hamlet program which was implemented by the south vietnamese government .
it involved certain forced relocation , village internment , and segregation of rural south vietnamese from the northern and southern communist insurgents .
kennedy was assassinated on november 22 , 1963 in dallas , texas .
lee harvey oswald was charged with the crime , but he was shot and killed by jack ruby two days later , before a trial could take place .
the fbi and the warren commission officially concluded that oswald was the lone assassin .
however , the united states house select committee on assassinations hsca concluded that those investigations were flawed and that kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy .
however , abc news in their investigation , the kennedy assassination : beyond conspiracy , confirmed the findings of the warren commission ; having concluded oswald acted alone .
kennedy 's controversial department of defense tfx fighter bomber program led to a congressional investigation that lasted from 1963 to 1970 .
since the 1960s information concerning kennedy 's private life has come to light .
details of kennedy 's health problems in which he struggled have become better known , especially since the 1990s .
although initially kept secret from the general public , reports of kennedy 's philandering have garnered much press .
kennedy ranks highly in public opinion ratings of u.s. presidents .

a metaphor is a figure of speech that describes a subject by asserting that it is , on some point of comparison , the same as another otherwise unrelated object .
metaphor is a type of analogy and is closely related to other rhetorical figures of speech that achieve their effects via association , comparison or resemblance including allegory , hyperbole , and simile .
in simpler terms , a metaphor compares two objects or things without using the words `` like '' or `` as '' .
one of the most prominent examples of a metaphor in english literature is the all the world 's a stage monologue from as you like it :
all the world 's a stage ,
and all the men and women merely players ;
they have their exits and their entrances ; ??? william shakespeare , as you like it , 2\/7
this quote is a metaphor because the world is not literally a stage .
by figuratively asserting that the world is a stage , shakespeare uses the points of comparison between the world and a stage to convey an understanding about the mechanics of the world and the lives of the people within it

adolf hitler committed suicide by gunshot on 30 april 1945 in his f ?? hrerbunker in berlin .
his wife eva n ?? e braun committed suicide with him by ingesting cyanide .
that afternoon , in accordance with hitler 's prior instructions , their remains were carried up the stairs through the bunker 's emergency exit , doused in petrol and set alight in the reich chancellery garden outside the bunker .
the soviet archives record that their burnt remains were recovered and interred in successive locations until 1970 when they were again exhumed , cremated and the ashes scattered .
accounts differ as to the cause of death ; one that he died by poison only and another that he died by a self-inflicted gunshot , while biting down on a cyanide capsule .
contemporary historians have rejected these accounts as being either soviet propaganda or an attempted compromise in order to reconcile the different conclusions .
one eye-witness recorded that the body showed signs of having been shot through the mouth , but this has been proven unlikely .
there is also controversy regarding the authenticity of skull and jaw fragments which were recovered .
in 2009 , dna tests were performed on a skull soviet officials had long believed to be hitler 's .
the tests revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman less than 40 years old .
world war ii wwii or ww2 , also known as the second world war , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 .
it involved the vast majority of the world 's nations ??? including all of the great powers ??? eventually forming two opposing military alliances : the allies and the axis .
it was the most widespread war in history , with more than 100 million people serving in military units from over 30 different countries .
in a state of '' total war '' , the major participants placed their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort , erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources .
marked by mass deaths of civilians , including the holocaust and the only use of nuclear weapons in warfare , it resulted in 50 million to over 75 million fatalities .
these deaths make world war ii by far the deadliest conflict in human history .

from late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , germany formed the axis alliance with italy , conquering or subduing much of continental europe .
following the molotov ??? ribbentrop pact , germany and the soviet union partitioned and annexed territories between themselves of their european neighbors , including poland .
the united kingdom and the other members of the british commonwealth were the only major allied forces continuing the fight against the axis , with battles taking place in north africa as well as the long-running battle of the atlantic
in june 1941 , the european axis launched an invasion of the soviet union , giving a start to the largest land theater of war in history , which tied down the major part of the axis ' military forces
in december 1941 , japan joined the axis , attacked the united states and european territories in the pacific ocean , and quickly conquered much of the western pacific .
the axis advance was stopped in 1942 , after japan lost a series of naval battles and european axis troops were defeated in north africa and , decisively , at stalingrad .
in 1943 , with a series of german defeats in eastern europe , the allied invasion of italy , and american victories in the pacific , the axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts .
in 1944 , the western allies invaded france , while the soviet union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded germany and its allies .
during 1944 and 1945 the united states defeated the japanese navy and captured key western pacific islands .
the war in europe ended with the capture of berlin by soviet and polish troops and the subsequent german unconditional surrender on 8 may 1945 .
following the potsdam declaration by the allies on 26 july 1945 , the united states dropped atomic bombs on the japanese cities of hiroshima on 6 august , and nagasaki on 9 august .

world war ii altered the political alignment and social structure of the world .
the united nations un was established to foster international cooperation and prevent future conflicts .
the great powers that were the victors of the war ??? the united states , the soviet union , china , the united kingdom , and france ??? became the permanent members of the united nations security council .
the soviet union and the united states emerged as rival superpowers , setting the stage for the cold war , which lasted for the next 46 years .
meanwhile , the influence of european great powers started to decline , while the decolonisation of asia and africa began .

conventional pci pci is an initialism formed from peripheral component interconnect , part of the pci local bus standard and often shortened to just pci is a local computer bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer .
the pci bus supports the functions found on a processor bus , but in a standardized format that is independent of any particular processor .
devices connected to the bus appear to the processor to be connected directly to the processor bus , and are assigned addresses in the processor 's address space .
attached devices can take either the form of an integrated circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself , called a planar device in the pci specification , or an expansion card that fits into a slot .
the pci local bus was first implemented in ibm pc compatibles , where it displaced the combination of isa plus one vesa local bus as the bus configuration .
it has subsequently been adopted for other computer types .
pci and pci-x are being replaced by pci express , but , most motherboards are still made with one or more pci slots , which are sufficient for many uses .
the pci specification covers the physical size of the bus including the size and spacing of the circuit board edge electrical contacts , electrical characteristics , bus timing , and protocols .
the specification can be purchased from the pci special interest group pci-sig .
typical pci cards used in pcs include : network cards , sound cards , modems , extra ports such as usb or serial , tv tuner cards and disk controllers .
pci video cards replaced isa and vesa cards , until growing bandwidth requirements outgrew the capabilities of pci ; the preferred interface for video cards became agp , and then pci express .
pci video cards remain available for use with old pcs without agp or pci express slots .
many devices previously provided on pci expansion cards are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in universal serial bus and pci express versions .
the history of television comprises the work of numerous engineers and inventors in several countries over many decades .
the earliest proposal was in 1908 , in a paper by a. a. campbell-swinton and postulated the use of cathode rays .
the first practical demonstrations of television , however , were developed using electromechanical methods to scan , transmit , and reproduce an image .
as electronic camera and display tubes were perfected , electromechanical television gave way to all-electronic systems in nearly all applications .
lyme disease , lyme borreliosis is an infectious disease caused by at least three species of bacteria belonging to the genus borrelia .
borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto is the main cause of lyme disease in north america , whereas borrelia afzelii and borrelia garinii cause most european cases .
the disease is named after the towns of lyme and old lyme , connecticut , usa , where a number of cases were identified in 1975 .
although allen steere realized that lyme disease was a tick-borne disease in 1978 , the cause of the disease remained a mystery until 1981 , when b. burgdorferi was identified by willy burgdorfer .
lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the northern hemisphere .
borrelia is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected ticks belonging to a few species of the genus ixodes `` hard ticks '' .
early symptoms may include fever , headache , fatigue , depression , and a characteristic circular skin rash called erythema migrans em .
left untreated , later symptoms may involve the joints , heart , and central nervous system .
in most cases , the infection and its symptoms are eliminated by antibiotics , especially if the illness is treated early .
delayed or inadequate treatment can lead to more serious symptoms , which can be disabling and difficult to treat .

iodine is a chemical element with symbol i and atomic number 53 .
the name is from greek ioeid ?? s , meaning violet or purple , due to the color of elemental iodine vapor .
iodine and its compounds are primarily used in nutrition , and industrially in the production of acetic acid and certain polymers .
iodine 's relatively high atomic number , low toxicity , and ease of attachment to organic compounds have made it a part of many x-ray contrast materials in modern medicine .
iodine has only one stable isotope .
a number of iodine radioisotopes are also used in medical applications .
iodine is found on earth mainly as the highly water-soluble iodide ion , i ??? , which concentrates it in oceans and brine pools .
like the other halogens , free iodine occurs mainly as a diatomic molecule i2 , and then only momentarily after being oxidized from iodide by an oxidant like free oxygen .
in the universe and on earth , iodine 's high atomic number makes it a relatively rare element .
however , its presence in ocean water has given it a role in biology .
it is the heaviest essential element utilized widely by life in biological functions only tungsten , employed in enzymes by a few species of bacteria , is heavier .
iodine 's rarity in many soils , due to initial low abundance as a crust-element , and also leaching of soluble iodide by rainwater , has led to many deficiency problems in land animals and inland human populations .
iodine deficiency affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities .
iodine is required by higher animals , which use it to synthesize thyroid hormones , which contain the element .
because of this function , radioisotopes of iodine are concentrated in the thyroid gland along with nonradioactive iodine .
if inhaled , the radioisotope iodine-131 , which has a high fission product yield , concentrates in the thyroid , but is easily remedied with potassium iodide treatment .
lobbying also lobby is the act of attempting to influence decisions made by officials in the government , most often legislators or members of regulatory agencies .
lobbying is done by many different types of people and organized groups , including individuals in the private sector , corporations , fellow legislators or government officials , or advocacy groups interest groups .
lobbyists may be among a legislator 's constituencies , meaning a voter or bloc of voters within his or her electoral district , or not ; they may engage in lobbying as a business , or not .
professional lobbyists are people whose business is trying to influence legislation on behalf of a group or individual who hires them .
individuals and nonprofit organizations can also lobby as an act of volunteering or as a small part of their normal job for instance , a ceo meeting with a representative about a project important to his\/her company , or
governments often define and regulate organized group lobbying that has become influential .
the ethics and morality of lobbying are .
lobbying is often spoken of with contempt , when the implication is that people with inordinate socioeconomic power are corrupting the law twisting it away from fairness in order to serve their own conflict of interest .
but another side of lobbying is making sure that others ' interests are duly defended against others ' corruption , or even simply making sure that minority interests are fairly defended against mere tyranny of the majority .
for example , a medical association , or a trade association of health insurance companies , may lobby a legislature in order to counteract the influence of tobacco companies , in which case the lobbying would be viewed by most
the difficulty in drawing objective lines between which lobbyists are `` good lobbyists '' and which ones are `` bad ones '' is compounded by the cleverness with which lobbyists or their clients can argue that their own lobbying is
at heart , the effort to influence legislation is a power struggle .
as in other forms of power struggle , such as war or law enforcement , motives range from to self-defense to fighting for justice , and the dividing line between predation and justice is subject to rationalization .

1804 map of '' louisiana '' , edged on the west by the rocky mountains .
the louisiana purchase `` sale of louisiana '' was the acquisition by the united states of america in 1803 of of france 's claim to the territory of louisiana .
the u.s. paid 50 million francs $ 11 ,250,000 plus cancellation of debts worth 18 million francs $ 3,750,000 , for a total sum of 15 million dollars less than 3 cents per acre
the louisiana territory encompassed all or part of 15 present u.s. states and two canadian provinces .
the land purchased contained all of present-day arkansas , missouri , iowa , oklahoma , kansas , and nebraska ; parts of minnesota that were west of the mississippi river ; most of north dakota ; most of south dakota
france controlled this vast area from 1699 until 1762 , the year it gave the territory to its ally spain .
under napoleon bonaparte , france took back the territory in 1800 in the hope of building an empire in north america .
a slave revolt in haiti and an impending war with britain , however , led france to abandon these plans and sell the entire territory to the united states , who had originally intended only to seek the purchase of
the purchase of the territory of louisiana took place during the presidency of thomas jefferson .
at the time , the purchase faced domestic opposition because it was thought to be unconstitutional .
although he agreed that the u.s. constitution did not contain provisions for acquiring territory , jefferson decided to go ahead with the purchase anyway in order to remove france 's presence in the region and to protect both u.s. trade

`` cool jerk '' is a popular song written by donald storball and originally performed by the capitols .
released in 1966 , it reached no. 2 on the american r&b chart and no. 7 on the pop chart .
the backing track for this song was actually recorded secretly by the motown house band the funk brothers .
per one of the funk brothers , the song was originally to be called `` pimp jerk . ''
this was taken from watching neighborhood pimps , who would dance in the clubs , but were too `` cool '' to do the jerk like regular folks .
their version was subsequently named `` the pimp jerk . ''
the producer was afraid that a song with the word pimp in the title would be banned or not receive much positive attention , and had the title changed to its current form .
the go-go 's , todd rundgren , big trouble , human sexual response , the la de da 's , the creation , and the coasters have covered the song .
todd rundgren did his version in an odd time signature 7\/4 , giving an obviously jerky feel to the song .
the go-go 's covered the song for their 1982 album vacation and later re-recorded it for their 1990 album greatest .
in the feature film home alone 2 : lost in new york , uncle frank gerry bamman sings `` cool jerk '' in the shower .
a version of the song with different lyrics `` do the cool whip '' is used in cool whip commercials .
a recording of `` cool jerk '' by ricardo ray is featured in the feature film donnie brasco 1997 .
the song features in the film standing in the shadows of motown , performed by the funk brothers with lead vocals by bootsy collins .
the song is heard briefly in the animated feature , madagascar 3 : europe 's most wanted .
despite this reason , it is listed in some variations of the film 's soundtrack .
a league is a unit of length or , rarely , area .
it was long common in europe and latin america , but it is no longer an official unit in any nation .
the league originally referred to the distance a person could walk in an hour .
since the middle ages , many values have been specified in several countries .
in the context of nautical distances , the 3 mile 4.8 km distance corresponds to how far an observer of average height 5 ' 9 '' or 1.78 m can see when standing at sea level
thus , a ship traveling one `` league '' has reached what was previously the farthest visible distance on the horizon .
the lack of a historical and global standard for the exact measure of a `` league '' can be accounted for by the variable elevation of the observer i.e. , sightings from a ship 's deck vs. masthead

race is a classification system used to categorize humans into large and distinct populations or groups by anatomical , cultural , ethnic , genetic , geographical , historical , linguistic , religious , or social affiliation .
first used to denote national affiliations , the term began to be used to relate to physical traits in the 17th century .
in the early 20th century the term was often used , in a taxonomic sense , to denote genetically differentiated human populations defined by phenotype .
while biologists sometimes use the concept of race to make distinctions among fuzzy sets of traits , others in the scientific community suggest that the idea of race often is used in a naive or simplistic way , i.e. that
social conceptions and groupings of races vary over time , involving folk taxonomies
that define of individuals based on perceived traits .
scientists consider biological essentialism obsolete , and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits .
since the second half of the 20th century the associations of race with the ideologies and theories that grew out of the work of 19th-century anthropologists and physiologists has led to the use of the word race itself becoming problematic
although still used in general contexts , it is now often replaced by other words which are less ambiguous and emotionally charged , such as populations , people s , ethnic groups or communities depending on context .
lucy stone august 13 , 1818 ??? october 19 , 1893 was a prominent american abolitionist and suffragist , and a vocal advocate and organizer promoting rights for women .
in 1847 , stone became the first woman from massachusetts to earn a college degree .
she spoke out for women 's rights and against slavery at a time when women were discouraged and prevented from public speaking .
stone was the first recorded american woman to retain her own last name after marriage .
stone 's organizational activities for the cause of women 's rights yielded tangible gains in the difficult political environment of the 19th century .
stone helped initiate the first national women 's rights convention and she supported and sustained it annually along with a number of other local , state and regional activist conventions .
stone spoke in front of a number of legislative bodies to promote laws giving more rights to women .
she assisted in establishing the woman 's national loyal league to help pass the thirteenth amendment and thereby abolish slavery , after which she helped form the largest group of like-minded women 's rights reformers , the politically moderate american
stone wrote extensively about a wide range of women 's rights , publishing and distributing speeches by herself and others , and convention proceedings .
in the long-running and influential woman 's journal , a weekly periodical that she established and promoted , stone aired both her own and differing views about women 's rights .
called `` the orator '' and `` the morning star of the woman 's rights movement '' , stone delivered a speech which sparked susan b. anthony to take up the cause of women 's suffrage .
elizabeth cady stanton wrote that `` lucy stone was the first person by whom the heart of the american public was deeply stirred on the woman question . ''
together , anthony , stanton , and stone have been called the 19th century '' triumvirate '' of women 's suffrage and feminism .
in finance , a bond is an instrument of indebtedness of the bond issuer to the holders .
it is a debt security , under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and , depending on the terms of the bond , is obliged to pay them interest the coupon or to repay the principal
interest is usually payable at fixed intervals semiannual , annual , sometimes monthly .
very often the bond is negotiable , i.e. the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market .
thus a bond is a form of loan or iou : the holder of the bond is the lender creditor , the issuer of the bond is the borrower debtor , and the coupon is the
bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments , or , in the case of government bonds , to finance current expenditure .
certificates of deposit cds or short term commercial paper are considered to be money market instruments and not bonds : the main difference is in the length of the term of the instrument .
bonds and stocks are both securities , but the major difference between the two is that capital stockholders have an equity stake in the company i.e. they are owners , whereas bondholders have a creditor stake
another difference is that bonds usually have a defined term , or maturity , after which the bond is redeemed , whereas stocks may be outstanding indefinitely .
an exception is an irredeemable bond , such as consols , which is a perpetuity , i.e. a bond with no maturity .
old sparky , the electric chair used at sing sing prison
execution by electrocution , usually performed using an electric chair , is an execution method originating in the united states in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the
this execution method was created by employees of thomas edison during the war of currents , and has been used only in the united states and , for a period of several decades , in the philippines its first
historically , once the condemned person was attached to the chair , various cycles differing in voltage and duration of alternating current would be passed through the individual 's body , in order to cause fatal damage to
the first jolt of electric current was designed to cause immediate unconsciousness and brain death ; the second one was designed to cause fatal damage to the vital organs .
death was frequently caused by electrical overstimulation of the heart .
although in the united states the electric chair has become a symbol of the death penalty , its use is in decline due to the rise of lethal injection , which is widely believed to be a more humane method
although some states still maintain electrocution as a method of execution , today it is only maintained as a secondary method that may be chosen over lethal injection at the request of the prisoner .
as of 2010 , electrocution is an optional form of execution in alabama , florida , south carolina and virginia .
they allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an alternative method .
in the states of kentucky and tennessee , the electric chair has been retired except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to legislated dates in 1998 kentucky : march 31 , 1998 ; tennessee : december 31
in both states , inmates who do not choose electrocution or inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date are killed by lethal injection .
the electric chair is an alternate form of execution approved for potential use in arkansas and oklahoma if other forms of execution are found unconstitutional in the state at the time of execution .
it is the sole method of execution in vermont , where treason is the only capital crime .
on february 8 , 2008 , the nebraska supreme court determined that execution by electric chair was a `` cruel and unusual punishment '' under the state 's constitution .
this brought executions of this type to an end in nebraska , the only remaining state to retain electrocution as its sole method of execution for murder .
the liberation of paris also known as the battle for paris took place during world war ii from 19 august 1944 until the surrender of the occupying german garrison on 25 august .
the liberation of paris started with an uprising by the french resistance against the german garrison .
on 24 august , the french forces of the interior forces fran ?? aises de l'int ?? rieur , ffi received reinforcements from the free french army of liberation and from the u.s. third army under general patton
the capital region of france had been governed by nazi germany since the signing of the second compi ?? gne armistice in june 1940 , when the german army occupied northern and westernmost france , and when the puppet regime
this battle marked the liberation of paris and the exile of the vichy government to sigmaringen in germany .
however , there was still much heavy fighting to be done before france was liberated , including the campaign in southern france during august-september in provence and extending into the southwestern region of the vosges mountains , along
the german army and ss fought doggedly in these areas for the remainder of 1944 and into 1945 .

top left : the tennessee valley authority , part of the new deal , being signed into law in 1933 .
top right : franklin delano roosevelt , who was responsible for initiatives and programs collectively known as the new deal .
bottom : a public mural from one of the artists employed by the new deal .
the new deal was a series of economic programs enacted in the united states between 1933 and 1936 .
they involved presidential executive orders or laws passed by congress during the first term of president franklin d. roosevelt .
the programs were in response to the great depression , and focused on what historians call the `` 3 rs '' : relief , recovery , and reform .
that is relief for the unemployed and poor ; recovery of the economy to normal levels ; and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression .
the new deal produced a political realignment , making the democratic party the majority as well as the party that held the white house for seven out of nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969 , with its
the republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire new deal as an enemy of business and growth , and liberals accepting some of it and promising to make it more efficient .
the realignment crystallized into the new deal coalition that dominated most presidential elections into the 1960s , while the opposition conservative coalition largely controlled congress from 1937 to 1963 .
by 1936 the term `` liberal '' typically was used for supporters of the new deal , and '' conservative '' for its opponents .
from 1934 to 1938 , roosevelt was assisted in his endeavors by a ??? pro-spender ??? majority in congress drawn from two-party , competitive , non-machine , progressive , and left party districts .
as noted by alexander hicks , ??? roosevelt , backed by rare , non-southern democrat majorities ??? 270 non-southern democrat representatives and 71 non-southern democrat senators ??? spelled second new deal reform . ???
many historians distinguish between a `` first new deal '' 1933 ??? 34 and a `` second new deal '' 1935 ??? 38 , with the second one more liberal and more controversial .
the `` first new deal '' 1933 ??? 34 dealt with diverse groups , from banking and railroads to industry and farming , all of which demanded help for economic survival .
the federal emergency relief administration , for instance , provided $ 500 million for relief operations by states and cities , while the short-lived cwa civil works administration gave localities money to operate make-work projects in 1933-34 .
the '' second new deal '' in 1935 ??? 38 included the wagner act to promote labor unions , the works progress administration wpa relief program which made the federal government by far the largest single employer
the final major items of new deal legislation were the creation of the united states housing authority and farm security administration , both in 1937 , and the fair labor standards act of 1938 , which set maximum hours and
the economic downturn of 1937 ??? 38 , and the bitter split between the afl and cio labor unions led to major republican gains in congress in 1938 .
conservative republicans and democrats in congress joined in the informal conservative coalition .
by 1942 ??? 43 they shut down relief programs such as the wpa and ccc and blocked major liberal proposals .
roosevelt himself turned his attention to the war effort , and won reelection in 1940 and 1944 .
the supreme court declared the national recovery administration nra and the first version of the agricultural adjustment act aaa unconstitutional , however the aaa was rewritten and then upheld .
as the first republican president elected after fdr , dwight d. eisenhower 1953 ??? 61 left the new deal largely intact , even expanding it in some areas .
in the 1960s , lyndon b. johnson 's great society used the new deal as inspiration for a dramatic expansion of liberal programs , which republican richard m. nixon generally retained .
after 1974 , however , the call for deregulation of the economy gained bipartisan support .
the new deal regulation of banking glass ??? steagall act was suspended in the 1990s .
many new deal programs remain active , with some still operating under the original names , including the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic , the federal crop insurance corporation fcic , the federal housing administration
the largest programs still in existence today are the social security system and the securities and exchange commission sec .

written by diane warren , the song debuted at number one on the billboard hot 100 the first # 1 for the band after 28 years together .
the song stayed at number one for four weeks from september 5 to september 26 , 1998 .

in the uk , the song peaked at number four , becoming aerosmith 's highest charting song in the uk , where it was the 17th best-selling single of 1998 , and has sold over a million copies .
although not used by the majority of the world 's countries , daylight saving time is common in the western world .
daylight saving time dst ??? also summer time in british english ??? is the practice of advancing clocks during the lighter months so that evenings have more daylight and mornings have less .
typically clocks are adjusted forward one hour near the start of spring and are adjusted backward in autumn .
the modern idea of daylight saving was first proposed in 1895 by george vernon hudson and it was first implemented during the first world war .
many countries have used it at various times since then .
much of the united states used dst in the 1950s and 1960s , and dst use expanded following the 1970s energy crisis and has been widely used in north america and europe since then .
the practice has been both praised and criticized .
adding daylight to evenings benefits retailing , sports , and other activities that exploit sunlight after working hours , but can cause problems for evening entertainment and other occupations tied to the sun .
although an early goal of dst was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting formerly a primary use of electricity , modern heating and cooling usage patterns differ greatly , and research about how dst currently affects energy
dst clock shifts present other challenges .
they complicate timekeeping , and can disrupt meetings , travel , billing , record keeping , medical devices , heavy equipment , and sleep patterns .
software can often adjust computer clocks automatically , but this can be limited and error-prone , particularly when dst dates are changed .

the lord of the rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by english philologist and university of oxford professor j. r. r. tolkien .
the story began as a sequel to tolkien 's 1937 children 's fantasy novel the hobbit , but eventually developed into a much larger work .
it was written in stages between 1937 and 1949 , much of it during world war ii .
it is the second best-selling novel ever written , with over 150 million copies sold .
the title of the novel refers to the story 's main antagonist , the dark lord sauron , who had in an earlier age created the one ring to rule the other rings of power as the ultimate weapon in
from quiet beginnings in the shire , a hobbit land not unlike the english countryside , the story ranges across north-west middle-earth , following the course of the war of the ring through the eyes of its characters , notably
the work was initially intended by tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set , with the other being the silmarillion , but this idea was dismissed by his publisher .
it was decided for economic reasons to publish the lord of the rings as three volumes over the course of a year from 29 july 1954 to 20 october 1955 , thus creating the now familiar lord of the rings
the three volumes were entitled the fellowship of the ring , the two towers , and the return of the king .
structurally , the novel is divided internally into six books , two per volume , with several appendices of background material included at the end of the third volume .
the lord of the rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into many languages .
tolkien 's work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins .
although a major work in itself , the story was only the last movement of a larger epic tolkien had worked on since 1917 , in a process he described as mythopoeia .
influences on this earlier work , and on the story of the lord of the rings , include philology , mythology , religion and the author 's distaste for the effects of industrialization , as well as earlier fantasy works
the lord of the rings in its turn is considered to have had a great effect on modern fantasy ; the impact of tolkien 's works is such that the use of the words `` tolkienian '' and `` tolkienesque
the enduring popularity of the lord of the rings has led to numerous references in popular culture , the founding of many societies by fans of tolkien 's works , and the publication of many books about tolkien and his
the lord of the rings has inspired , and continues to inspire , artwork , music , films and television , video games , and subsequent literature .
award-winning adaptations of the lord of the rings have been made for radio , theater , and film .
in computing , a file system or filesystem is a type of data store which can be used to store , retrieve and update a set of files .
the term could refer to the abstract data structures used to define files , or to the actual software or firmware components that implement the abstract ideas .
some file systems are used on local data storage devices ; others provide file access via a network protocol e.g. nfs , smb , or 9p clients .
some file systems are `` virtual '' , in that the `` files '' supplied are computed on request e.g. procfs or are merely a mapping into a different file system used as a backing store .
the file system manages access to both the content of files and the metadata about those files .
it is responsible for arranging storage space ; reliability , efficiency , and tuning with regard to the physical storage medium are important design considerations .
william howard taft september 15 , 1857 ??? march 8 , 1930 was the 27th president of the united states 1909 ??? 1913 and later the tenth chief justice of the united states 1921 ???
he is the only person to have served in both of these offices .
before becoming president , taft , a republican , was selected to serve on the superior court of cincinnati in 1887 .
in 1890 , taft was appointed solicitor general of the united states and in 1891 a judge on the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit .
in 1900 , president william mckinley appointed taft governor-general of the philippines .
in 1904 , president theodore roosevelt appointed taft secretary of war in an effort to groom taft , then his close political ally , into his handpicked presidential successor .
taft assumed a prominent role in problem solving , assuming on some occasions the role of acting secretary of state , while declining repeated offers from roosevelt to serve on the supreme court .
riding a wave of popular support for fellow republican roosevelt , taft won an easy victory in his 1908 bid for the presidency .
in his only term , taft 's domestic agenda emphasized trust-busting , civil service reform , strengthening the interstate commerce commission , improving the performance of the postal service , and passage of the sixteenth amendment .
abroad , taft sought to further the economic development of nations in latin america and asia through '' dollar diplomacy '' , and showed decisiveness and restraint in response to revolution in mexico .
the task-oriented taft was oblivious to the political ramifications of his decisions , often alienated his own key constituencies , and was overwhelmingly defeated in his bid for a second term in the presidential election of 1912 .
in surveys of presidential scholars , taft is usually ranked near the middle of lists of all american presidents .
after leaving office , taft spent his time in academia , arbitration , and the search for world peace through his self-founded league to enforce peace .
in 1921 , after the first world war , president warren g. harding appointed taft chief justice of the united states .
taft served in this capacity until shortly before his death in 1930 .

a cooling bath , in laboratory chemistry often but not always organic chemistry practice , is a liquid mixture which is used to maintain low temperatures , typically between 13 ?? c and ??? 196 ?? c.
these low temperatures are used to collect liquids after distillation , to remove solvents using a rotary evaporator , or to perform a chemical reaction below room temperature see : kinetic control .
cooling baths are generally one of two types : a a cold fluid particularly liquid nitrogen , water , or even air ??? but most commonly the term refers to b a mixture of
-lrb- a familiar example of this is the use of an ice\/rock-salt mixture to freeze ice cream .
the phase-change of ice into liquid water requires energy , ` pulling ' heat from the system .
adding salt lowers the temp at which this happens , meaning more energy has to be absorbed from the environment in order to melt the ice .
this effectively makes the ice ` colder ' ??? it must ` pull ' more heat from its environment to become liquid .
slavery in the united states existed from the early years of the colonial period ; it was firmly established by the time the united states sought independence from great britain in 1776 .
however , by 1804 , all states north of the mason and dixon line had either abolished slavery outright or passed laws for the gradual abolition of slavery .
in 1787 congress prohibited slavery in the northwest territory .
but slavery gained new life in the south with the cotton industry after 1800 , and expanded into the southwest .
the nation was polarized into slave and free states along the mason-dixon line , which separated pennsylvania and maryland .
the united states and great britain both prohibited the international slave trade in 1808 , but the domestic trade , with sales to the deep south , expanded dramatically , and many captives were shipped by the coastwise slave trade
before the 1840s , the south was vigorously defending slavery and its expansion into the territories .
in the north some abolitionists denounced it as sinful , and numerous anti-slavery forces rejected it as detrimental to the rights of free men .
after failed compromises and abraham lincoln 's election , in 1861 eleven slave states broke away to form the confederate states of america , leading to the american civil war .
the federal government in 1862 made abolition of slavery a war goal .
in january 1863 president lincoln freed slaves in the confederacy through the emancipation proclamation .
after the war , the thirteenth amendment , effective december 1865 , abolished slavery throughout the entire united states , including the border states and the indian territories .
from the 16th to the 19th centuries , an estimated 12 million africans were shipped as slaves to the americas .
see slavery in the americas .
the great majority went to the sugar plantations of the west indies or brazil , where mortality was high .
about 645,000 were brought to what is now the united states .
by the 1860 united states census , the slave population in the american south had grown to four million .
of all 1,515,605 families in the 15 slave states , nearly 400,000 held slaves roughly one in four , amounting to 8 % of all american families .
while some slaves worked as house servants and urban artisans , the great majority worked on plantations or large farms , cultivating lucrative cash crops , such as rice , tobacco , sugar and , after 1800 , chiefly cotton
by 1860 most slaves were held in the deep south , where they served in work-gangs ; two-thirds worked in cotton .
in small operations , they worked with their owners .
in large plantations they were directed by white paid overseers .
under the system that became chattel slavery ownership of a human being , and of his\/her descendants , a racial element was fundamental : slaves were blacks of african descent and owned , almost universally , by whites
in the 17th century , virginia , followed by other southern colonies , enacted law that children of slave mothers were born into slavery .
slaves could gain freedom only by running away which was difficult and illegal to do , or by manumission by owners , which was regulated by states , and became increasingly difficult or prohibited .
in the earliest era of chattel slavery , the colonies also organized work by a system of bonded labor known as indentured servitude .
this typically lasted for several years for both poor europeans and africans alike , to pay off the costs of transport to the colonies .
they contracted for such arrangements because of poor economies in their home countries .
between 1680 and 1700 , as fewer europeans migrated to the colonies , planters began to import more africans as slaves .
recognizing the importance of slavery , the house of burgesses in virginia enacted a new slave code in 1705 ; it combined a variety of legislation and added new provisions enforcing white supremacy in the law .

kansas is a u.s. state located in the midwestern united states .
it is named after the kansas river which flows through it , which in turn was named after the kansa native american tribe , which inhabited the area .
the tribe 's name natively kk ?? : ze is often said to mean `` people of the wind '' or `` people of the south wind , '' although this was probably not the term 's original
residents of kansas are called `` kansans . ''
for thousands of years what is now kansas was home to numerous and diverse native american tribes .
tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys .
tribes in the western part of the state were semi - nomadic and hunted large herds of bison .
kansas was first settled by european americans in the 1830s , but the pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery issue .
when officially opened to settlement by the u.s. government in 1854 , abolitionist free-staters from new england and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring missouri rushed to the territory to determine if kansas would become a free state or a slave state
thus , the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided , and was known as bleeding kansas .
the abolitionists eventually prevailed and on january 29 , 1861 , kansas entered the union as a free state .
after the civil war , the population of kansas grew rapidly , when waves of immigrants turned the prairie into farmland .
today , kansas is one of the most productive agricultural states , producing high yields of wheat , sorghum and sunflowers .
kansas is the 15th most extensive and the 33rd most populous of the 50 united states .
thomas jefferson april 13 , 1743 april 2 , 1743 o.s. ??? july 4 , 1826 was an american founding father , the principal author of the declaration of independence 1776 and the third
at the beginning of the american revolution , he served in the continental congress , representing virginia and then served as a wartime governor of virginia 1779 ??? 1781 .
just after the war ended , from mid-1784 jefferson served as a diplomat , stationed in paris .
in may 1785 , he became the united states minister to france .
jefferson was the first united states secretary of state 1790 ??? 1793 serving under president george washington .
with his close friend james madison he organized the democratic-republican party , and subsequently resigned from washington 's cabinet .
elected vice president in 1796 , when he came in second to john adams of the federalists , jefferson opposed adams and with madison secretly wrote the kentucky and virginia resolutions , which attempted to nullify the alien and sedition
elected president in what jefferson called the revolution of 1800 , he oversaw the purchase of the vast louisiana territory from france 1803 , and sent the lewis and clark expedition 1804 ??? 1806 to explore
his second term was beset with troubles at home , such as the failed treason trial of his former vice president aaron burr .
with escalating trouble with britain who was challenging american neutrality and threatening shipping at sea , he tried economic warfare with his embargo laws which only damaged american trade .
in 1803 , president jefferson initiated a process of indian tribal removal and relocation to the louisiana territory west of the mississippi river , in order to open lands for eventual american settlers .
a leader in the enlightenment , jefferson was a polymath who spoke five languages fluently and was deeply interested in science , invention , architecture , religion and philosophy , interests that led him to the founding of the university
he designed his own large mansion on a 5,000 acre plantation near charlottesville , virginia , which he named monticello .
while not a notable orator , jefferson was a skilled writer and corresponded with many influential people in america and europe throughout his adult life .
though jefferson owned many slaves , he opposed the institution all his life and consequently treated and took care of them very well and expected them to work no more than free farmers .
since 1802 historians and others have been divided over the controversy of whether jefferson was the father of one or more children belonging to sally hemings , a slave at monticello . ''
historians are also in disagreement with how much jefferson was committed to the anti-slavery cause .
in 1807 , president jefferson signed into law a bill that banned the importation of slaves into the united states .
after martha jefferson , his wife of eleven years , died in 1782 , jefferson remained a widower for the rest of his life ; their marriage produced six children , of whom two survived to adulthood .
though jefferson has been criticized by many modern day scholars over the issue of slavery , he remains rated as one of the greatest u.s. presidents .

the five sets of the board game monopoly depicted here show the evolution of the game 's artwork and designs in the united states from 1935 ??? 2005 .
the history of the board game monopoly can be traced back to the early 20th century .
the earliest known design was by the american , elizabeth magie , patented in 1904 but existing as early as 1902 .
magie 's original intent was to publish a board game to illustrate an economic principle , namely the georgist concept of a single land value tax .
a series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land .
by 1934 , a board game had been created much like the version of monopoly sold by parker brothers and its related companies through the rest of the 20th century , and into the 21st .
several people , mostly in the midwestern united states and near the east coast , contributed to the game 's design and evolution .
by the 1970s , the idea that the game had been created solely by charles darrow had become popular folklore ; it was printed in the game 's instructions for many years , in a 1974 book devoted to monopoly
even a guide to family games published for reader 's digest in 2003 only gave credit to darrow and elizabeth magie , erroneously stating that magie 's original game was created in the 1800s , and not acknowledging any of
also in the 1970s , professor ralph anspach , who had himself published a board game intended to illustrate the principles of both monopolies and trust busting , fought parker brothers and its then parent company , general mills ,
through the research of anspach and others , much of the early history of the game was `` rediscovered '' .
anspach confronted maxine brady , author of the 1974 book the monopoly book : strategy and tactics of the world 's most popular game over the actual history of the game on barry farber 's new york city talk show
because of the lengthy court process , including appeals , the legal status of parker brothers ' trademarks on the game was not settled until 1985 .
the game 's name remains a registered trademark of parker brothers , as do its specific design elements .
at the conclusion of the court case , the game 's logo and graphic design elements became part of a larger monopoly brand , licensed by parker brothers ' parent companies onto a variety of items through the present day
despite the `` rediscovery '' of the board game 's early history in the 1970s and 1980s , and several books and journal articles on the subject , hasbro parker brothers ' current parent company did not acknowledge
nor did hasbro acknowledge anyone other than darrow in materials published or sponsored by them , at least as recently as 2006 .
international tournaments , first held in the early 1970s , continue to the present , with the next world championship likely scheduled for 2013 .
starting in 1985 , a new generation of spin-off board games and card games appeared on both sides of the atlantic ocean .
in 1989 , the first of many video game and computer game editions was published .
since 1994 , many official variants of the game , based on locations other than atlantic city , new jersey the official u.s. setting or london the official commonwealth setting , excepting canada , have been
in 2008 , hasbro permanently changed the color scheme and some of the gameplay of the standard u.s. edition of the game to match the uk edition , although the u.s. standard edition maintains the atlantic city property names .
hasbro also modified the official logo to give the `` mr. monopoly '' character a 3-d computer-generated look , which has since been adopted by licensees usaopoly , winning moves and winning solutions .
and hasbro has also been including the speed die , introduced in 2006 's monopoly : the mega edition by winning moves games , in versions produced directly by hasbro such as the 2009 championship edition .

naturally occurring cobalt co is composed of 1 stable isotope , 59co . 28 radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 60co with a half-life of 5.2714 years , 57co with a half-life of 271.79 days
all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 18 hours and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 1 second .
this element also has 11 meta states , all of which have half-lives less than 15 minutes .
the isotopes of cobalt range in atomic weight from 47co to 75co .
the primary decay mode for isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the most abundant stable isotope , 59co , is electron capture and the primary mode of decay for those of greater than 59 atomic mass
the primary decay products before 59co are iron isotopes and the primary products after are nickel isotopes .

nikita sergeyevich khrushchev ??? september 11 , 1971 led the soviet union during part of the cold war .
he served as first secretary of the communist party of the soviet union from 1953 to 1964 , and as chairman of the council of ministers , or premier , from 1958 to 1964 .
khrushchev was responsible for the partial de-stalinization of the soviet union , for backing the progress of the early soviet space program , and for several relatively liberal reforms in areas of domestic policy .
khrushchev 's party colleagues removed him from power in 1964 , replacing him with leonid brezhnev as first secretary and alexei kosygin as premier .
khrushchev was born in the russian village of kalinovka in 1894 , close to the present-day border between russia and ukraine .
he was employed as a metalworker in his youth , and during the russian civil war was a political commissar .
with the help of lazar kaganovich , he worked his way up the soviet hierarchy .
he supported joseph stalin 's purges , and approved thousands of arrests .
in 1939 , stalin sent him to govern ukraine , and he continued the purges there .
during what was known in the soviet union as the great patriotic war eastern front of world war ii , khrushchev was again a commissar , serving as an intermediary between stalin and his generals .
khrushchev was present at the bloody defense of stalingrad , a fact he took great pride in throughout his life .
after the war , he returned to ukraine before being recalled to moscow as one of stalin 's close advisers .
in the power struggle triggered by stalin 's death in 1953 , khrushchev , after several years , emerged victorious .
on february 25 , 1956 , at the 20th party congress , he delivered the '' secret speech , '' denouncing stalin 's purges and ushering in a less repressive era in the soviet union .
his domestic policies , aimed at bettering the lives of ordinary citizens , were often ineffective , especially in the area of agriculture .
hoping eventually to rely on missiles for national defense , khrushchev ordered major cuts in conventional forces .
despite the cuts , khrushchev 's rule saw the tensest years of the cold war , culminating in the cuban missile crisis .
some of khrushchev 's policies were seen as erratic , particularly by his emerging rivals , who quietly rose in strength and deposed him in october 1964 .
he did not suffer the deadly fate of some previous losers of soviet power struggles , but was pensioned off with an apartment in moscow and a dacha in the countryside .
his lengthy memoirs were smuggled to the west and published in part in 1970 .
khrushchev died in 1971 of heart disease .
knuckle mnemonic for the number of days in each month of the gregorian calendar .
each projecting knuckle represents a 31-day month .
a mnemonic , with a silent `` m '' , or mnemonic device , is any learning technique that aids information retention .
mnemonics aim to translate information into a form that the human brain can retain better than its original form .
even the process of applying this conversion might already aid the transfer of information to long-term memory .
commonly encountered mnemonics are often for lists and in auditory form , such as short poems , acronyms , or memorable phrases , but mnemonics can also be for other types of information and in visual or kinesthetic forms .
their use is based on the observation that the human mind more easily remembers spatial , personal , surprising , physical , sexual , humorous , or otherwise ` relatable ' information , rather than more abstract or impersonal forms
the word mnemonic is derived from the ancient greek word ???????????????????? mn ?? monikos , meaning `` of memory '' and is related to mnemosyne `` remembrance '' , the name of the goddess of memory
both of these words are derived from ?????????? mn ?? m ?? , `` remembrance , memory '' .
mnemonics in antiquity were most often considered in the context of what is today known as the art of memory .
ancient greeks and romans distinguished between two types of memory : the ` natural ' memory and the ` artificial ' memory .
the former is inborn , and is the one that everyone uses automatically and without thinking .
the artificial memory in contrast has to be trained and developed through the learning and practicing of a variety of mnemonic techniques .
mnemonic systems are special techniques or strategies consciously used to improve memory , it helps employ information already stored in long-term memory to make memorization an easier task .

world war i wwi was a global war centred in europe that began on 28 july 1914 and lasted until 11 november 1918 .
it was predominantly called the world war or the great war from its occurrence until the start of world war ii in 1939 , and the first world war or world war i thereafter .
it involved all the world 's great powers , which were assembled in two opposing alliances : the allies based on the triple entente of the united kingdom , france and russia and the central powers originally
these alliances were both reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : italy , japan and the united states joined the allies , and the ottoman empire and bulgaria the central powers .
ultimately , more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history .
more than 9 million combatants were killed , largely because of technological advancements that led to enormous increases in the lethality of weapons without corresponding improvements in protection or mobility .
it was the fifth - deadliest conflict in world history , subsequently paving the way for various political changes , such as revolutions in many of the nations involved .
one of the long-term causes of the war was the resurgence of imperialism in the foreign policies of the great powers of europe .
more immediately , the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand of austria , the heir to the throne of austria-hungary , on 28 june 1914 by yugoslav nationalist gavrilo princip in sarajevo triggered a diplomatic crisis when austria-hungary subsequently delivered an
several alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked .
within weeks , the major powers were at war and , via their colonies , the conflict soon spread around the world .
on 28 july , the austro-hungarians fired the first shots of the war as preparation for the invasion of serbia .
while the russians mobilised , the germans invaded neutral belgium and luxembourg on the way to france , providing a casus belli for britain 's declaration of war against germany .
after the german march on paris was brought to a halt ??? the so-called miracle of the marne ??? the western front settled into a static battle of attrition with a trench line that changed little until 1917 .
on the eastern front , the russian army was successful against the austro-hungarians , but was stopped in its invasion of east prussia by the germans .
in november the ottoman empire joined the war , opening up fronts in the caucasus , mesopotamia and the sinai .
italy and bulgaria went to war in 1915 and romania in 1916 .
in russia , the tsar 's government collapsed in march 1917 and a subsequent revolution in november brought the russians to terms with the central powers .
after a 1918 german offensive along the western front , the allies drove back the germans in a series of successful offensives and american forces began entering the trenches .
germany , which had its own trouble with revolutionaries , agreed to an armistice on 11 november 1918 .
the war ended in victory for the allies .
events on the home fronts were as tumultuous as on the battle fronts , as the participants tried to mobilize their manpower and economic resources to fight a total war .
by the end of the war , four major imperial powers ??? the german , russian , austro-hungarian and ottoman empires ??? ceased to exist .
the successor states of the former two lost a great amount of territory , while the latter two were dismantled entirely .
the map of central europe was redrawn into several smaller states .
the league of nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict .
the european nationalism spawned by the war and the breakup of empires , the repercussions of germany 's defeat and problems with the treaty of versailles are agreed to be factors contributing to world war ii .

view of defibrillator electrode position and placement .
defibrillation is a common treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias , ventricular fibrillation , and pulseless ventricular tachycardia .
defibrillation consists of delivering a therapeutic dose of electrical energy to the affected heart with a device called a defibrillator .
this depolarizes a critical mass of the heart muscle , terminates the dysrhythmia , and allows normal sinus rhythm to be reestablished by the body 's natural pacemaker , in the sinoatrial node of the heart .
defibrillators can be external , transvenous , or implanted , depending on the type of device used or needed .
some external units , known as automated external defibrillators aeds , automate the diagnosis of treatable rhythms , meaning that lay responders or bystanders are able to use them successfully with little , or in some cases no

an example of a demand curve shifting .
the shift from d1 to d2 means an increase in demand with consequences for the other variables
in economics , the demand curve is the graph depicting the relationship between the price of a certain commodity and the amount of it that consumers are willing and able to purchase at that given price .
it is a graphic representation of a demand schedule .
the demand curve for all consumers together follows from the demand curve of every individual consumer : the individual demands at each price are added together .
demand curves are used to estimate behaviors in competitive markets , and are often combined with supply curves to estimate the equilibrium price the price at which sellers together are willing to sell the same amount as buyers together
in a monopolistic market , the demand curve facing the monopolist is simply the market demand curve .

rms titanic was a british passenger liner that sank in the north atlantic ocean on 15 april 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from southampton , uk to new york city , us .
the sinking of titanic caused the deaths of 1,502 people in one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in modern history .
the rms titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time of her maiden voyage .
she was the second of three olympic class ocean liners operated by the white star line , and she was built by the harland and wolff shipyard in belfast with thomas andrews , who perished with the ship , as
on her maiden voyage , she carried 2,224 passengers and crew .
under the command of edward smith , her passengers included some of the wealthiest people in the world , as well as hundreds of emigrants from great britain and ireland , scandinavia and elsewhere throughout europe seeking a new life
the ship was designed to be the last word in comfort and luxury , with an on-board gymnasium , swimming pool , libraries , high-class restaurants and opulent cabins .
she also had a powerful wireless telegraph provided for the convenience of passengers as well as for operational use .
though she had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors , she lacked enough lifeboats to accommodate all of those aboard .
because of outdated maritime safety regulations , she carried only enough lifeboats for 1,178 people ??? slightly more than half of the number traveling on the maiden voyage , and one-third her total passenger and crew capacity .
after leaving southampton on 10 april 1912 , titanic called at cherbourg in france and queenstown now cobh in ireland before heading westwards towards new york .
on 14 april 1912 , four days into the crossing and about 375 miles 600 km south of newfoundland , she hit an iceberg at 11:40 pm ship 's time .
the glancing collision caused titanics hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea ; the ship gradually filled with water .
meanwhile , passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats , many of which were launched only partly loaded .
a disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a '' women and children first '' protocol followed by some of the officers loading the lifeboats .
by 2:20 am , she broke apart and foundered , with well over one thousand people still aboard .
just under two hours after the titanic foundered , the cunard liner rms carpathia arrived on the scene of the sinking , where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors .
the disaster was greeted with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life and the regulatory and operational failures that had led to it .
public inquiries in britain and the united states led to major improvements in maritime safety .
one of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the international convention for the safety of life at sea solas , which still governs maritime safety today .
additionally , several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications -- which could have saved many more passengers .
many of the survivors lost all of their money and possessions and were left destitute ; many families , particularly those of crew members from southampton , lost their primary bread-winners .
they were helped by an outpouring of public sympathy and charitable donations .
some of the male survivors were accused of cowardice for leaving the ship while people were still on board ; the white star line 's chairman , j. bruce ismay , faced social ostracism for the rest of his life
the wreck of the titanic remains on the seabed , split in two and gradually disintegrating at a depth of .
since its discovery in 1985 , thousands of artefacts have been recovered and put on display at museums around the world .
titanic has become one of the most famous ships in history , her memory kept alive by numerous books , folk songs , films , exhibits , and memorials .

james madison , jr. march 16 , 1751 o.s. march 5 ??? june 28 , 1836 was an american statesman and political theorist , the fourth president of the united states 1809 ??? 1817
he is hailed as the ??? father of the constitution ??? for being instrumental in the drafting of the united states constitution and as the key champion and author of the united states bill of rights .
he served as a politician much of his adult life .
after the constitution had been drafted , madison became one of the leaders in the movement to ratify it .
his collaboration with alexander hamilton and john jay produced the federalist papers 1788 .
circulated only in new york at the time , they would later be considered among the most important polemics in support of the constitution .
he was also a delegate to the virginia constitutional ratifying convention , and was instrumental to the successful ratification effort in virginia .
like most of his contemporaries , madison changed his political views during his life .
during the drafting and ratification of the constitution , he favored a strong national government , though later he grew to favor stronger state governments , before settling between the two extremes late in his life .
in 1789 , madison became a leader in the new house of representatives , drafting many basic laws .
he is notable for drafting the first ten amendments to the constitution , and thus is known as the `` father of the bill of rights '' .
madison worked closely with president george washington to organize the new federal government .
breaking with hamilton and what became the federalist party in 1791 , madison and thomas jefferson organized what they called the republican party later called by historians the democratic-republican party
as jefferson ??? s secretary of state 1801 ??? 1809 , madison supervised the louisiana purchase , which doubled the nation ??? s size .
after his election to the presidency , he presided over renewed prosperity for several years .
as president 1809 ??? 17 , after the failure of diplomatic protests and a trade embargo against great britain , he led the nation into the war of 1812 .
he was responding to british encroachments on american honor and rights ; in addition , he wanted to end the influence of the british among their indian allies , whose resistance blocked united states settlement in the midwest around the
madison found the war to be an administrative nightmare , as the united states had neither a strong army nor financial system ; as a result , he afterward supported a stronger national government and a strong military , as
like other virginia statesmen in the slave society , he was a slaveholder who inherited his plantation known as montpelier , and owned hundreds of slaves during his lifetime to cultivate tobacco and other crops .
madison supported the three-fifths compromise that allowed three-fifths of the enumerated population of slaves to be counted for representation .

the american middle class is a social class in the united states .
while the concept is typically ambiguous in popular opinion and common language use , contemporary social scientists have put forward several , more or less congruent , theories on the american middle class .
depending on class model used , the middle class may constitute anywhere from 25 % to 66 % of households .
one of the first major studies of the middle class in america was white collar : the american middle classes , published in 1951 by sociologist c. wright wright_mills mills wright_mills .
later sociologists such as dennis gilbert of hamilton college commonly divide the middle class into two sub-groups .
constituting roughly 15 % to 20 % of households is the upper or professional middle class consisting of highly educated , salaried professionals and managers .
constituting roughly one third of households is the lower middle class consisting mostly of semi-professionals , skilled craftsmen and lower-level management .
middle-class persons commonly have a comfortable standard of living , significant economic security , considerable work autonomy and rely on their expertise to sustain themselves .
members of the middle class belong to diverse groups which overlap with each other .
overall , middle-class persons , especially upper-middle-class individuals , are characterized by conceptualizing , creating and consulting .
thus , college education is one of the main indicators of middle-class status .
largely attributed to the nature of middle-class occupations , middle class values tend to emphasize independence , adherence to intrinsic standards , valuing innovation and respecting non-conformity .
politically more active than other demographics , college educated middle class professionals are split between the two major parties .
income varies considerably from near the national median to well in excess of $ 100,000 .
household income figures , however , do not always reflect class status and standard of living , as they are largely influenced by the number of income earners and fail to recognize household size .
it is therefore possible for a large , dual-earner , lower middle class household to out-earn a small , one-earner , upper middle class household .
the middle classes are very influential , as they encompass the majority of voters , writers , teachers , journalists , and editors .
most societal trends in the us originate within the middle classes .
ruins from the 1906 san francisco earthquake , remembered as one of the worst natural disasters in united states history
a disaster is a natural or man-made or technological hazard resulting in an event of substantial extent causing significant physical damage or destruction , loss of life , or drastic change to the environment .
a disaster can be ostensively defined as any tragic event stemming from events such as earthquakes , floods , catastrophic accidents , fires , or explosions .
it is a phenomenon that can cause damage to life and property and destroy the economic , social and cultural life of people .
in contemporary academia , disasters are seen as the consequence of inappropriately managed risk .
these risks are the product of a combination of both hazard\/s and vulnerability .
hazards that strike in areas with low vulnerability will never become disasters , as is the case in uninhabited regions .
developing countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits ??? more than 95 percent of all deaths caused by disasters occur in developing countries , and losses due to natural disasters are 20 times greater as a percentage

human immunodeficiency virus hiv is a lentivirus slowly replicating retrovirus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids , a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and
infection with hiv occurs by the transfer of blood , semen , vaginal fluid , pre-ejaculate , or breast milk .
within these bodily fluids , hiv is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells .
hiv infects vital cells in the human immune system such as helper t cells specifically cd4 + t cells , macrophages , and dendritic cells .
hiv infection leads to low levels of cd4 + t cells through a number of mechanisms including : apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells , direct viral killing of infected cells , and killing of infected cd4 + t cells by
when cd4 + t cell numbers decline below a critical level , cell-mediated immunity is lost , and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections .

written simlish
simlish is a fictional language featured in ea games ' sim series of games .
it debuted in simcopter , and has been especially prominent in the sims , the sims 2 and the sims 3 .

civilized creatures in spore can also be taught to speak simlish .
it is also featured to an extent in firaxis games ' sid meier 's simgolf .
designer will wright was conscious of the need for dialogue in the game , but thought that using a real language would make it sound too repetitive and would also be too costly to hire translators for world languages .
initially , inspired by the native american code talkers of world war ii , sims creator will wright and language expert marc gimbel suggested experimenting with the navajo language to create simlish .
however , they ultimately decided that simlish worked best as a `` language '' made up of gibberish words that could n't be translated , so that its meaning would be left open to the imagination of the player .
wright later commented that using `` nonsense language '' turned out to be the right development choice , as people were capable of imagining it more realistically than a computer could simulate a real one .
the actual sound of simlish was created improvisationally by voice actors stephen kearin and gerri lawlor .

the watergate scandal was a political scandal that occurred in the united states in the 1970s as a result of the june 17 , 1972 break-in at the democratic national committee headquarters at the watergate office complex in washington ,
the scandal eventually led to the resignation of richard nixon , the president of the united states , on august 9 , 1974 ??? the only resignation of a u.s. president .
the scandal also resulted in the indictment , trial , conviction , and incarceration of forty-three persons , dozens of whom were nixon 's top administration officials .
the affair began with the arrest of five men for breaking and entering into the democratic national committee dnc headquarters at the watergate complex on june 17 , 1972 .
the federal bureau of investigation fbi connected cash found on the burglars to a slush fund used by the committee for the re-election of the president , the official organization of nixon 's campaign .
in july 1973 , as evidence mounted against the president 's staff , including testimony provided by former staff members in an investigation conducted by the senate watergate committee , it was revealed that president nixon had a tape-recording system
recordings from these tapes implicated the president , revealing he had attempted to cover up the questionable and illegal goings-on that had taken place during his administration , both before and after the break-in .
after a protracted series of bitter court battles , the u.s. supreme court unanimously ruled that the president had to hand over the tapes to government investigators ; he ultimately complied .
facing near-certain impeachment in the house of representatives and a strong possibility of a conviction in the senate , nixon resigned the presidency on august 9 , 1974 .
his successor , gerald ford , then issued a pardon to him .

the united states presidency of ronald reagan , also known as the reagan administration , was a republican administration headed by ronald reagan from january 20 , 1981 , to january 20 , 1989 .
domestically , the administration favored reducing government programs and introduced the largest across-the-board tax cuts in american history .
the economic policies enacted in 1981 , known as '' reaganomics '' , were an example of supply-side economics .
reagan aimed to encourage entrepreneurship and limit the growth of social spending , as well as the reduction of regulation and inflation .
economic growth saw a strong recovery in the 1980s , helping reagan to win a landslide re-election .
the national debt increased significantly , however .
regarding foreign policy , the administration was steadfastly anti-communist , calling the soviet union an '' evil empire '' and ending 1970s d ?? tente .
reagan accelerated the massive buildup of the military started by his predecessor , including an invasion of grenada , the first major overseas action by u.s. troops since the end of the vietnam war .
the '' reagan doctrine '' controversially granted aid to paramilitary forces seeking to overthrow communist governments , particularly in war-torn central america and afghanistan .
reagan also promoted new technologies such as missile defense systems in order to confront the soviets and their allies .
in diplomacy , reagan forged a strong alliance with uk prime minister margaret thatcher , and he met with soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev four times , aiming to shrink the superpowers ' nuclear arsenals .
reagan 's presidency has been termed the `` reagan revolution '' , or the age of reagan in recognition of the political realignment both within and beyond the u.s. in favor of his brand of conservatism and his faith in
the reagan administration worked toward the collapse of soviet communism , and it did collapse just as he left office .
victory in the cold war led to a unipolar world with the u.s. as the world 's sole superpower .
while the damaging iran-contra affair engulfed several reagan aides during his second term , reagan himself left office with a 63 percent approval rating , one of the higher approval ratings of departing presidents .
after years of unstinting praise from the right , and unrelenting criticism from the left , historian david henry finds that by 2009 a consensus had emerged among scholars that reagan revived conservatism and turned the nation to the right
furthermore , says henry , the consensus viewpoint agrees that he revived faith in the presidency and american self-confidence , and contributed critically to ending the cold war .
an otoacoustic emission oae is a sound which is generated from within the inner ear .
having been predicted by thomas gold in 1948 , its existence was first demonstrated experimentally by david kemp in 1978 and otoacoustic emissions have since been shown to arise by a number of different cellular mechanisms within the inner ear
studies have shown that oaes disappear after the inner ear has been damaged , so oaes are often used in the laboratory and the clinic as a measure of inner ear health .
broadly speaking , there are two types of otoacoustic emissions : spontaneous otoacoustic emissions soaes , which can occur without external stimulation , and evoked otoacoustic emissions eoaes , which require an evoking stimulus .

postmodern literature is literature characterized by heavy reliance on techniques like fragmentation , paradox , and questionable narrators , and is often though not exclusively defined as a style or trend which emerged in the post ??? world
postmodern works are seen as a reaction against enlightenment thinking and modernist approaches to literature .
postmodern literature , like postmodernism as a whole , tends to resist definition or classification as a '' movement '' .
indeed , the convergence of postmodern literature with various modes of critical theory , particularly reader-response and deconstructionist approaches , and the subversions of the implicit contract between author , text and reader by which its works are often characterised
while there is little consensus on the precise characteristics , scope , and importance of postmodern literature , as is often the case with artistic movements , postmodern literature is commonly defined in relation to a precursor .
for example , a postmodern literary work tends not to conclude with the neatly tied-up ending as is often found in modernist literature , but often parodies it .
postmodern authors tend to celebrate chance over craft , and further employ metafiction to undermine the writer 's authority .
another characteristic of postmodern literature is the questioning of distinctions between high and low culture through the use of pastiche , the combination of subjects and genres not previously deemed fit for literature .

he was drafted in the first round of the 2009 nfl draft as the fifth overall selection by the jets and the second quarterback taken overall .
he played college football at the university of southern california usc .
sanchez grew up in a well-disciplined and athletic family .
in the eighth grade , he began to play football and learn the intricacies of the quarterback position , training with his father , nick .
a well-regarded prospect , sanchez committed to southern california following his successful high school career in which he led his team to a championship title during his final season .
at usc , sanchez was relegated as the backup quarterback during his first three years though he rose to prominence due to his brief appearances on the field in 2007 due to injuries suffered by starting quarterback john david booty
sanchez also became popular within the community due to his mexican-american heritage .
named the starter in 2008 , sanchez led usc to a 12 ??? 1 record and won the rose bowl against penn state for which sanchez was awarded the most valuable player award for his performance on offense .
although many considered him too inexperienced , sanchez announced his intention to enter the 2009 nfl draft .
he was selected by the jets after they traded up with the cleveland browns , and was named the starting quarterback prior to the start of the season .
despite a subpar performance , sanchez led the jets to the afc championship game , a losing effort to the indianapolis colts , becoming the fourth rookie quarterback in nfl history to win his first playoff game and the second

a small submersible ac sump pump with a garden hose connector
a sump pump is a pump used to remove water that has accumulated in a water collecting sump basin , commonly found in the basement of homes .
the water may enter via the perimeter drains of a basement waterproofing system , funneling into the basin or because of rain or natural ground water , if the basement is below the water table level .
sump pumps are used where basement flooding happens regularly and to remedy dampness where the water table is above the foundation of a home .
sump pumps send water away from a house to any place where it is no longer problematic , such as a municipal storm drain or a dry well .
pumps may discharge to the sanitary sewer in older installations .
once considered acceptable , this practice may now violate the plumbing code or municipal bylaws , because it can overwhelm the municipal sewage treatment system .
municipalities urge homeowners to disconnect and reroute sump pump discharge away from sanitary sewers .
fines may be imposed for noncompliance .
many homeowners have inherited their sump pump configurations and do not realize that the pump discharges to the sewer .
if the discharge is fed to a laundry sink in the basement , it 's likely going to the sewer .
usually hardwired into a home 's electrical system , sump pumps may have a battery backup .
the home 's pressurized water supply powers some pumps , eliminating the need for electricity at the expense of using potable water , potentially making them more expensive to operate than electrical pumps and creating an additional water disposal problem
since a sump basin may overflow if not constantly pumped , a backup system is important for cases when the main power is out for prolonged periods of time , as during a severe storm .
there are generally two types of sump pumps ??? pedestal and submersible .
the pedestal pump 's motor is mounted above the sump , where it is more easily serviced , but is also more conspicuous .
the pump impeller is driven by a long , vertical extension shaft and the impeller is in a scroll housing in the base of the pump .
the submersible pump is entirely mounted inside the sump , and is specially sealed to prevent electrical short circuits .
sump pump systems are also utilized in industrial and commercial applications to control water table - related problems in surface soil .
an artesian aquifer or periodic high water table situation can cause the ground to become unstable due to water saturation .
as long as the pump functions , the surface soil will remain stable .
these sumps are typically ten feet in depth or more ; lined with corrugated metal pipe that contains perforations or drain holes throughout .
they may include electronic control systems with visual and audible alarms and are usually covered to prevent debris and animals from falling in .
bleeding kansas , bloody kansas or the border war , was a series of violent political confrontations involving anti-slavery free-staters and pro-slavery '' border ruffian '' elements , that took place in the kansas territory and the neighboring towns of
at the heart of the conflict was the question of whether kansas would enter the union as a free state or slave state .
as such , bleeding kansas was a proxy war between northerners and southerners over the issue of slavery in the united states .
the term `` bleeding kansas '' was coined by horace greeley of the new york tribune ; the events it encompasses directly presaged the american civil war .
congress had long struggled to balance the interests of pro-slavery forces and anti-slavery forces .
the events later known as bleeding kansas were set into motion by the kansas ??? nebraska act of 1854 , which nullified the missouri compromise and instead implemented the concept of popular sovereignty .
an ostensibly democratic idea , popular sovereignty stated that the inhabitants of each territory or state should decide whether it would be a free or slave state ; however , this resulted in immigration en masse to kansas by activists
at one point , kansas had two separate governments , each with its own constitution , although only one was federally recognized .
on january 29 , 1861 , kansas was admitted to the union as a free state , less than three months before the battle of fort sumter which began the civil war .

kennywood is an amusement park located in west mifflin , pennsylvania , a suburb of pittsburgh .
the park first opened in 1898 as a `` trolley park '' attraction at the end of the mellon family 's monongahela street railway .
the park was purchased in 1906 by f. w. henninger and andrew mcswigan and thus began the kennywood entertainment company that has remained a closely held family business for over 100 years .
this traditional amusement park still has structures and rides dating back to its opening and the early 1900s .
along with rye playland park , it is one of only two amusement parks listed in the national register of historic places .
kennywood is owned by kennywood entertainment company , which until december 2007 was a closely held family business owned by the henninger and mcswigan families .
kennywood entertainment is now operated by california-based palace entertainment , a subsidiary of parques reunidos , an international amusement park company based in madrid , spain .
parque reunidos is in turn a subsidiary of candover investments , an investment fund based in the uk .

minimalism describes movements in various forms of art and design , especially visual art and music , where the work is set out to expose the essence or identity of a subject through eliminating all non-essential forms , features or
minimalism is any design or style in which the simplest and fewest elements are used to create the maximum effect .
as a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post ??? world war ii western art , most strongly with american visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s .
prominent artists associated with this movement include donald judd , john mccracken , agnes martin , dan flavin , robert morris , anne truitt , and frank stella .
it is rooted in the reductive aspects of modernism , and is often interpreted as a reaction against abstract expressionism and a bridge to postminimal art practices .
the terms have expanded to encompass a movement in music which features repetition and iteration , as in the compositions of la monte young , terry riley , steve reich , philip glass , and john adams .
minimalist compositions are sometimes known as systems music .
the term `` minimalist '' is often applied colloquially to designate anything that is spare or stripped to its essentials .
it has also been used to describe the plays and novels of samuel beckett , the films of robert bresson , the stories of raymond carver , and even the automobile designs of colin chapman .
the word was first used in english in the early 20th century to describe the mensheviks .

labor unions are legally recognized as representatives of workers in many industries in the united states .
their activity today centers on collective bargaining over wages , benefits , and working conditions for their membership , and on representing their members in disputes with management over violations of contract provisions .
larger unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and electioneering at the state and federal level .
most unions in america are aligned with one of two larger umbrella organizations : the afl-cio created in 1955 , and the change to win federation which split from the afl-cio in 2005 .
both advocate policies and legislation on behalf of workers in the united states and canada , and take an active role in politics .
the afl-cio is especially concerned with global trade issues .
in 2010 , the percentage of workers belonging to a union in the united states or total labor union `` density '' was 11.4 % , compared to 18.4 % in germany , 27.5 % in canada ,
union membership in the private sector has fallen under 7 % ??? levels not seen since 1932 .
unions allege that employer-incited opposition has contributed to this decline in membership .
the most prominent unions are among public sector employees such as teachers and police .
members of unions are disproportionately older , male and residents of the northeast , the midwest , and california .
union workers average 10-30 % higher pay than non-union in america after controlling for individual , job , and labor market characteristics .
although much smaller compared to their peak membership in the 1950s , american unions remain a prominent political factor , both through mobilization of their own memberships and through coalitions with like-minded activist organizations around issues such as immigrant rights
to fight alleged employer anti-union programs , unions are currently advocating new '' card check '' federal legislation that would require employers to bargain with a union if more than 50 % of workers signed forms , or `` cards
the current procedure involves waiting 45 to 90 days for a federally supervised secret-ballot employee referendum on the subject .
the economist joseph stiglitz has asserted that , `` strong unions have helped to reduce inequality , whereas weaker unions have made it easier for ceos , sometimes working with market forces that they have helped shape , to increase
the decline in unionization since wwii in the united states has been associated with a pronounced rise in income and wealth inequality .

psychosis from the greek ???????? `` psyche '' , for mind\/soul , and - ???????? '' - osis '' , for abnormal condition or derangement refers to an abnormal condition of the mind , and is a generic
people suffering from psychosis are described as psychotic .
psychosis is given to the more severe forms of psychiatric disorder , during which hallucinations and delusions , gross excitement or stupor and impaired insight may occur .
the term `` psychosis '' is very broad and can mean anything from relatively normal aberrant experiences through to the complex and catatonic expressions of schizophrenia and bipolar type 1 disorder .
moreover a wide variety of central nervous system diseases , from both external substances and internal physiologic illness , can produce symptoms of psychosis .
this led many professionals to say that psychosis is not specific enough as a diagnostic term .
despite this , `` psychosis '' is generally given to noticeable deficits in normal behavior negative signs and more commonly to diverse types of hallucinations or delusional beliefs e.g. grandiosity , delusions of persecution .
someone exhibiting very obvious signs may be described as `` frankly psychotic '' , whereas one exhibiting very subtle signs could be classified in the category of an `` attenuated psychotic risk syndrome '' .
an excess in dopaminergic signalling is traditionally linked to the positive symptoms of psychosis , especially those of schizophrenia .
this is thought to occur through a mechanism of aberrant salience of environmental stimuli .
many antipsychotic drugs accordingly target the dopamine system ; meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials of these drugs , however , show either no significant difference between drug and placebo , or a very small effect size , suggesting that the pathophysiology
people experiencing psychosis may exhibit some personality changes and thought disorder .
depending on its severity , this may be accompanied by unusual or bizarre behavior , as well as difficulty with social interaction and impairment in carrying out daily life activities .
general grievous is a fictional character in the star wars universe .
a recurring antagonist , he is the supreme commander of the confederacy of independent systems , a political faction of planetary systems waging war on the galactic republic .
trained in all seven forms of lightsaber combat by count dooku , he is a ruthless and powerful warrior devoted to jedi 's destruction during the clone wars .
his acts of wanton aggression and high jedi body count would prompt the galaxy to give him the nickname the knightslayer .
though the notorious jedi slayer was the being in the galaxy during the clone wars who had killed the most jedi in single combat , he did not hesitate to flee from battles he knew he would lose .
a premature ventricular contraction pvc , also known as a premature ventricular complex , ventricular premature contraction or complex or complexes vpc , ventricular premature beat vpb , or ventricular extrasystole
the electrical events of the heart detected by the electrocardiogram allow a pvc to be easily distinguished from a normal heart beat .
a pvc may be perceived as a '' skipped beat '' or felt as palpitations in the chest .
in a normal heartbeat , the ventricles contract after the atria have helped to fill them by contracting ; in this way the ventricles can pump a maximized amount of blood both to the lungs and to the rest of
in a pvc , the ventricles contract first and before the atria have optimally filled the ventricles with blood , which means that circulation is inefficient .
however , single beat pvc arrhythmias do not usually pose a danger and can be asymptomatic in healthy individuals .
three different kinds of wheat and rye flour
flour is a powder which is made by grinding cereal grains , or other seeds or roots like cassava .
it is the main ingredient of bread , which is a staple food for many cultures , making the availability of adequate supplies of flour a major economic and political issue at various times throughout history .
wheat flour is one of the most important foods in european , north american , middle eastern , indian and north african cultures , and is the defining ingredient in most of their styles of breads and pastries .
while wheat is the most common base for flour , corn flour has been important in mesoamerican cuisine since ancient times , and remains a staple throughout the americas .
rye flour is an important constituent of bread in much of central europe , and rice can also be used in flour , though this is relatively uncommon .
heart rate is the number of heartbeats per unit of time , typically expressed as beats per minute bpm .
heart rate can vary as the body 's need to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide changes , such as during physical exercise , sleep , illness , or as a result of ingesting drugs :
central nervous system stimulants such as amphetamines increase heart rate .
central nervous system depressants or sedatives decreases the heart rate apart from some particularly strange ones with equally strange effects , such as ketamine which can cause - amongst many other things - stimulant-like effects such as tachycardia
there are many ways in which the heart rate speeds up or slows down .
most involve stimulant-like endorphins and hormones being released in the brain , many of which are those that are ` forced ' \/ ` enticed ' out by the ingestion and processing of drugs .
due to individuals having a constant blood volume , one of the physiological ways to deliver more oxygen to an organ is to increase heart rate to permit blood to pass by the organ more often .
normal resting heart rates range from 60-100 bpm .
bradycardia is defined as a resting heart rate below 60 bpm .
however , heart rates from 50 to 60 bpm are common among healthy people and do not necessarily require special attention .
tachycardia is defined as a resting heart rate above 100 bpm , though persistent rest rates between 80-100 bpm , mainly if they are present during sleep , may be signs of hyperthyroidism or anemia see below .

a carriage is a wheeled vehicle for people , usually horse-drawn ; litters palanquins and sedan chairs are excluded , since they are wheelless vehicles .
the carriage is especially designed for private passenger use and for comfort or elegance , though some are also used to transport goods .
it may be light , smart and fast or heavy , large and comfortable .
carriages normally have suspension using leaf springs , elliptical springs in the 19th century or leather strapping .
a public passenger vehicle would not usually be called a carriage ??? terms for such include stagecoach , charabanc and omnibus .
working vehicles such as the four-wheeled wagon and two-wheeled cart share important parts of the history of the carriage , as is the fast two-wheeled chariot .
the 2004 indian ocean earthquake was an undersea megathrust earthquake that occurred at 00:58:53 utc on sunday , 26 december 2004 , with an epicentre off the west coast of sumatra , indonesia .
the quake itself is known by the scientific community as the sumatra ??? andaman earthquake .
the resulting tsunami was given various names , including the 2004 indian ocean tsunami , south asian tsunami , indonesian tsunami , and the boxing day tsunami .
the earthquake was caused by subduction and triggered a series of devastating tsunamis along the coasts of most landmasses bordering the indian ocean , killing over 230,000 people in fourteen countries , and inundating coastal communities with waves up to
it was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history .
indonesia was the hardest-hit country , followed by sri lanka , india , and thailand .
with a magnitude of mw 9.1 ??? 9.3 , it is the third largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph .
the earthquake had the longest duration of faulting ever observed , between 8.3 and 10 minutes .
it caused the entire planet to vibrate as much as and triggered other earthquakes as far away as alaska .
its epicentre was between simeulue and mainland indonesia .
the plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response .
in all , the worldwide community donated more than $ 14 billion 2004 us$ in humanitarian aid .
steam rising from the nesjavellir geothermal power station in iceland .
geothermal energy is thermal energy generated and stored in the earth .
thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter .
the geothermal energy of the earth 's crust originates from the original formation of the planet 20 % and from radioactive decay of minerals 80 % .
the geothermal gradient , which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface , drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface .
the adjective geothermal originates from the greek roots ???? ge , meaning earth , and ???????????? thermos , meaning hot .
at the core of the earth , thermal energy is created by radioactive decay and temperatures may reach over 5000 ?? c 9,000 ?? f .
heat conducts from the core to surrounding cooler rock .
the high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt , creating magma convection upward since it is lighter than the solid rock .
the magma heats rock and water in the crust , sometimes up to 370 ?? c 700 ?? f .
from hot springs , geothermal energy has been used for bathing since paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient roman times , but it is now better known for electricity generation .
worldwide , about 10,715 megawatts mw of geothermal power is online in 24 countries .
an additional 28 gigawatts of direct geothermal heating capacity is installed for district heating , space heating , spas , industrial processes , desalination and agricultural applications .
geothermal power is cost effective , reliable , sustainable , and environmentally friendly , but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries .
recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources , especially for applications such as home heating , opening a potential for widespread exploitation .
geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth , but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels .
as a result , geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels .
the earth 's geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity 's energy needs , but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited .
drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive .
forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology , energy prices , subsidies , and interest rates .
pilot programs like eweb 's customer opt in green power program show that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a renewable energy source like geothermal .
but as a result of government assisted research and industry experience , the cost of generating geothermal power has decreased by 25 % over the past two decades .
in 2001 , geothermal energy cost between two and ten cents per kwh .
the term cubic foot is an imperial and us customary non - metric unit of volume , used in the united states and the united kingdom .

a central processing unit cpu , also referred to as a central processor unit , is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical , logical ,
the term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s .
the form , design , and implementation of cpus have changed over the course of their history , but their fundamental operation remains much the same .
a computer can have more than one cpu ; this is called multiprocessing .
some integrated circuits ics can contain multiple cpus on a single chip ; those ics are called multi-core processors .
two typical components of a cpu are the arithmetic logic unit alu , which performs arithmetic and logical operations , and the control unit cu , which extracts instructions from memory and decodes and executes them
not all computational systems rely on a central processing unit .
an array processor or vector processor has multiple parallel computing elements , with no one unit considered the `` center '' .
in the distributed computing model , problems are solved by a distributed interconnected set of processors .
the my lai massacre , ; , , or was the vietnam war mass murder of between 347 and 504 unarmed civilians in south vietnam on march 16 , 1968 , by united states army soldiers of ``
victims included women , men , children , and infants .
some of the women were gang-raped and their bodies were later found to be mutilated and many women were allegedly raped prior to the killings .
while 26 u.s. soldiers were initially charged with criminal offenses for their actions at m ??? lai , only second lieutenant william calley , a platoon leader in charlie company , was convicted .
found guilty of killing 22 villagers , he was originally given a life sentence , but only served three and a half years under house arrest .
the massacre took place in the hamlets of my lai and my khe of son my village .
the event is also known as the son my massacre , especially in the vietnamese state media .
the u.s. military codeword for the `` viet cong stronghold '' was `` pinkville '' .
the incident prompted global outrage when it became public knowledge in 1969 .
the massacre also increased domestic opposition to the u.s. involvement in the vietnam war .
three u.s. servicemen who had tried to halt the massacre and protect the wounded were initially denounced by several u.s. congressmen as traitors .
they received hate mail and death threats and found mutilated animals on their doorsteps .
the three were later widely praised and decorated by the army for their heroic actions .
heavy metal often referred to as metal is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s , largely in the united kingdom and in the united states .
with roots in blues rock and psychedelic rock , the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick , massive sound , characterized by highly amplified distortion , extended guitar solos , emphatic beats , and overall loudness .
heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are generally associated with masculinity and machismo .
the first heavy metal bands such as led zeppelin , deep purple and black sabbath attracted large audiences , though they were often derided by critics , a status common throughout the history of the genre .
in the mid-1970s judas priest helped spur the genre 's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence ; mot ?? rhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed .
bands in the new wave of british heavy metal such as iron maiden followed in a similar vein .
before the end of the decade , heavy metal fans became known as '' metalheads '' or '' headbangers '' .
during the 1980s , glam metal became a commercial force with groups like m ?? tley cr ?? e and poison .
underground scenes produced an array of more extreme , aggressive styles : thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as metallica , megadeth , slayer , and anthrax , while other styles of the most extreme subgenres of
since the mid-1990s , popular styles such as nu metal , which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop ; and metalcore , which blends extreme metal with hardcore punk , have further expanded the definition of the genre
the far-right also known as the extreme right refers to the highest degree of rightism in right-wing politics .
far right politics involves support of strong or complete social hierarchy in society , and supports supremacy of certain individuals or groups deemed to be innately superior or preferable who are to be more valued than those deemed to be
the far right 's advocacy of supremacism is based on what its adherents perceive as innate characteristics of people that can not be changed .
this stands as a point of difference with the centre-right 's attribution of behaviors , such as laziness or decadence , as the primary sources of social inequalities .
the center right ??? unlike the far right ??? claims that people can end their behavioural inferiority through changing their habits and choices .
the original far right , which emerged in france after the french revolution , refused to accept the french republic and supported a counter-revolution to restore the french monarchy and aristocracy .
the far right is commonly associated with persons or groups who hold extreme nationalist , xenophobic , racist , religious fundamentalist or reactionary views .
the most extreme-right movements have pursued oppression and genocide against groups of people on the basis of their alleged inferiority .
thomas hobbes of malmesbury 5 april 1588 ??? 4 december 1679 , in some older texts thomas hobbs of malmsbury , was an english philosopher , best known today for his work on political philosophy .
his 1651 book leviathan established the foundation for most of western political philosophy from the perspective of social contract theory .
hobbes was a champion of absolutism for the sovereign , but he also developed some of the fundamentals of european liberal thought : the right of the individual ; the natural equality of all men ; the artificial character of
he was one of the founders of modern political philosophy .
his understanding of humans as being matter and motion , obeying the same physical laws as other matter and motion , remains influential ; and his account of human nature as self-interested cooperation , and of political communities as being
in addition to political philosophy , hobbes also contributed to a diverse array of other fields , including history , geometry , the physics of gases , theology , ethics , and general philosophy .
emotional intelligence ei is the ability to identify , assess , and control the emotions of oneself , of others , and of groups .
it can be divided into ability ei and trait ei .
ability ei is usually measured using maximum performance tests and has stronger relationships with traditional intelligence , whereas trait ei is usually measured using self-report questionnaires and has stronger relationships with personality .
criticisms have centered on whether ei is a real intelligence and whether it has incremental validity over iq and the big five personality traits .
heredity is the passing of traits to offspring from its parents or ancestor .
this is the process by which an offspring cell or organism acquires or becomes predisposed to the characteristics of its parent cell or organism .
through heredity , variations exhibited by individuals can accumulate and cause some species to evolve .
the study of heredity in biology is called genetics , which includes the field of epigenetics .
a telephone prefix is the first set of digits of a telephone number ; in the north american numbering plan countries country code 1 , it is the first three digits of a seven-digit phone number .
in other countries both the prefix and the number may have different lengths .
it shows which exchange the remaining numbers refer to .
a full telephone number is usually made up of country code required for international calls only , area code required for calls between telephone areas , prefix , and subscriber number .
some places restrict certain prefixes to fax numbers or cell phones only ; in other places such dedicated prefixes are not used .
as telephone technology advanced , the precise significance of the prefix became blurred in many places ; 485 in london , uk , was once the gulliver exchange , but now 44207485xxxx is just considered one of many number blocks
metformin bp , pronounced , ; originally sold as glucophage is an oral antidiabetic drug in the biguanide class .
it is the first-line drug of choice for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , in particular , in overweight and obese people and those with normal kidney function .
its use in gestational diabetes has been limited by safety concerns .
it is also used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome , and has been investigated for other diseases where insulin resistance may be an important factor .
metformin works by suppressing glucose production by the liver .
metformin is the only antidiabetic drug that has been conclusively shown to prevent the cardiovascular complications of diabetes .
it helps reduce ldl cholesterol and triglyceride levels , and is not associated with weight gain .
, metformin is one of only two oral antidiabetics in the world health organization model list of essential medicines the other being glibenclamide .
when prescribed appropriately , metformin causes few adverse effects the most common is gastrointestinal upset and is associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia .
lactic acidosis a buildup of lactate in the blood can be a serious concern in overdose and when it is prescribed to people with contraindications , but otherwise , there is no significant risk .
first synthesized and found to reduce blood sugar in the 1920s , metformin was forgotten for the next two decades as research shifted to insulin and other antidiabetic drugs .
interest in metformin was rekindled in the late 1940s after several reports that it could reduce blood sugar levels in people , and in 1957 , french physician jean sterne published the first clinical trial of metformin as a treatment
it was introduced to the united kingdom in 1958 , canada in 1972 , and the united states in 1995 .
metformin is now believed to be the most widely prescribed antidiabetic drug in the world ; in the united states alone , more than 48 million prescriptions were filled in 2010 for its generic formulations .
the mount rushmore national memorial is a sculpture carved into the granite face of mount rushmore near keystone , south dakota , in the united states .
sculpted by danish-american gutzon borglum and his son , lincoln borglum , mount rushmore features sculptures of the heads of four united states presidents : george washington , thomas jefferson , theodore roosevelt and abraham lincoln .
the entire memorial covers and is above sea level .
the tallest mountain in the region is harney peak .
south dakota historian doane robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of carving the likenesses of famous people into the black hills region of south dakota in order to promote tourism in the region .
robinson 's initial idea was to sculpt the needles ; however , gutzon borglum rejected the needles site because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from environmentalists and native american groups .
they settled on the mount rushmore location , which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure .
robinson wanted it to feature western heroes like lewis and clark , red cloud and buffalo bill cody but borglum decided the sculpture should have a more national focus , and chose the four presidents whose likenesses would be carved
after securing federal funding , construction on the memorial began in 1927 , and the presidents ' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939 .
upon gutzon borglum 's death in march 1941 , his son lincoln borglum took over construction .
although the initial concept called for each president to be depicted from head to waist , lack of funding forced construction to end in late october 1941 .
the u.s. national park service took control of the memorial in 1933 , while it was still under construction , and has managed the memorial to the present day .

the united states presidential election of 1960 was the 44th quadrennial presidential election , held on tuesday , november 8 , 1960 .
the republican party nominated incumbent vice-president richard nixon , while the democratic party nominated john f. kennedy , senator from massachusetts .
the incumbent president , republican dwight d. eisenhower , was not eligible for re-election after serving the maximum two terms allowed by the twenty-second amendment .
kennedy was elected with a lead of 112,827 votes , or 0.17 % of the popular vote , giving him a victory of 303 to 219 in the electoral college , the closest since 1916 .
this was the first election in which all fifty of the current united states participated .
a number of factors explain why the election was so close .
kennedy gained since there was an economic recession which hurt the incumbent republican , and he had the advantage of 17 million more registered democrats than republicans .
furthermore , the new votes that kennedy gained among catholics almost neutralized the new votes nixon gained among protestants .
kennedy 's campaigning skills decisively outmatched nixon 's .
in the end , nixon 's emphasis on his experience carried little weight , and he wasted energy by campaigning in all 50 states instead of concentrating on the swing states .
kennedy used his large , well-funded campaign organization to win the nomination , secure endorsements , and , with the aid of the last of the big-city bosses , to get out the vote in the big cities .
he relied on running mate lyndon b. johnson to hold the south and used television effectively .
this election is notable as being the first time in u.s. history that two sitting u.s. senators kennedy and johnson were elected as president and vice-president , a phenomenon that has been repeated once , by barack obama

a dominant leader of the democratic party and the only american president elected to more than two terms , he built a new deal coalition that realigned american politics after 1932 , as his domestic policies defined american liberalism for
with the bouncy popular song '' happy days are here again '' as his campaign theme , fdr defeated incumbent republican herbert hoover in november 1932 , at the depth of the great depression .
energized by his personal victory over polio , fdr 's unfailing optimism and activism contributed to a renewal of the national spirit .
he worked closely with british prime minister winston churchill and soviet general secretary joseph stalin in leading the allies against germany and japan in world war ii , and restoring prosperity to the nation 's economy .
in his first hundred days in office , which began march 4 , 1933 , roosevelt spearheaded major legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the new deal ??? a variety of programs designed to produce relief
the economy improved rapidly from 1933 to 1937 , but then relapsed into a deep recession .
the bipartisan conservative coalition that formed in 1937 prevented his packing the supreme court or passing any considerable legislation ; it abolished many of the relief programs when unemployment diminished during world war ii .
most of the regulations on business were ended about 1975 ??? 85 , except for the regulation of wall street by the securities and exchange commission , which still exists .
along with several smaller programs , major surviving programs include the federal deposit insurance corporation , which was created in 1933 , and social security , which congress passed in 1935 .

he supervised the mobilization of the u.s. economy to support the allied war effort .
as an active military leader , roosevelt implemented an overall war strategy on two fronts that ended in the defeat of the axis powers and the development of the world 's first atom bomb .
in 1942 roosevelt ordered the internment of 100,000 japanese american civilians .
unemployment dropped to 2 % , relief programs largely ended , and the industrial economy grew rapidly to new heights as millions of people moved to new jobs in war centers , and 16 million men and 300,000 women were
roosevelt dominated the american political scene not only during the twelve years of his presidency , but also for decades afterward .
he orchestrated the realignment of voters that created the fifth party system .
fdr 's new deal coalition united labor unions , big city machines , white ethnics , african americans and rural white southerners .
he also influenced the later creation of the united nations and bretton woods .
roosevelt is consistently rated by scholars as one of the top three u.s. presidents , along with abraham lincoln and george washington .
a liberal democrat , roosevelt defined his ideological position as `` a little left of center . ''

vitamin a is a group of nutritionally unsaturated hydrocarbons , which include retinol , retinal , retinoic acid and several provitamin a carotenoids among which beta-carotene is the most important .
vitamin a has multiple functions , it is important for growth and development , for the maintenance of the immune system and good vision .
vitamin a is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of retinal , which combines with protein opsin to form rhodopsin the light-absorbing molecule , that is necessary for both low-light scotopic vision and color
vitamin a also functions in a very different role as an irreversibly oxidized form of retinol known as retinoic acid , which is an important hormone-like growth factor for epithelial and other cells .
in foods of animal origin , the major form of vitamin a is an ester , primarily retinyl palmitate , which is converted to retinol chemically an alcohol in the small intestine .
the retinol form functions as a storage form of the vitamin , and can be converted to and from its visually active aldehyde form , retinal .
the associated acid retinoic acid , a metabolite that can be irreversibly synthesized from vitamin a , has only partial vitamin a activity , and does not function in the retina for the visual cycle .
retinoic acid is used for growth and cellular differentiation .
all forms of vitamin a have a beta-ionone ring to which an isoprenoid chain is attached , called a retinyl group .
both structural features are essential for vitamin activity .
the orange pigment of carrots ??? beta-carotene ??? can be represented as two connected retinyl groups , which are used in the body to contribute to vitamin a levels .
alpha-carotene and gamma-carotene also have a single retinyl group , which give them some vitamin activity .
none of the other carotenes have vitamin activity .
the carotenoid beta - cryptoxanthin possesses an ionone group and has vitamin activity in humans .
vitamin a can be found in two principal forms in foods :
retinol , the form of vitamin a absorbed when eating animal food sources , is a yellow , fat-soluble substance .
since the pure alcohol form is unstable , the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester .
it is also commercially produced and administered as esters such as retinyl acetate or palmitate .
the carotenes alpha-carotene , beta-carotene , gamma-carotene ; and the xanthophyll beta-cryptoxanthin all of which contain beta-ionone rings , but no other carotenoids , function as provitamin a in herbivores and omnivore animals , which possess the enzyme
in general , carnivores are poor converters of ionine-containing carotenoids , and pure carnivores such as cats and ferrets lack 15-15 ' - dioxygenase and can not convert any carotenoids to retinal resulting in none of the carotenoids being

memorial day is a united states federal holiday which occurs every year on the final monday of may .
memorial day is a day of remembering the men and women who died while serving in the united states armed forces .
formerly known as decoration day , it originated after the american civil war to commemorate the union and confederate soldiers who died in the civil war .
by the 20th century memorial day had been extended to honor all americans who have died in all wars .
it typically marks the start of the summer vacation season , while labor day marks its end .
many people visit cemeteries and memorials , particularly to honor those who have died in military service .
many volunteers place an american flag on each grave in national cemeteries .
by the early 20th century , memorial day was an occasion for more general expressions of memory , as people visited the graves of their deceased relatives in church cemeteries , whether they had served in the military or not
it also became a long weekend increasingly devoted to shopping , family gatherings , fireworks , trips to the beach , and national media events .
annual decoration days for particular cemeteries are held on a sunday in late spring or early summer in some rural areas of the american south , notably in the mountains .
in cases involving a family graveyard where remote ancestors as well as those who were deceased more recently are buried , this may take on the character of an extended family reunion to which some people travel hundreds of miles
people gather on the designated day and put flowers on graves and renew contacts with kinfolk and others .
there often is a religious service and a `` dinner on the ground , '' the traditional term for a potluck meal in which people used to spread the dishes out on sheets or tablecloths on the grass .
it is believed that this practice began before the american civil war and thus may reflect the real origin of the `` memorial day '' idea .
memorial day is not to be confused with veterans day ; memorial day is a day of remembering the men and women who died while serving , while veterans day celebrates the service of all u.s. military veterans , living

designed and built by the bell punch co .
in britain , and marketed through its sumlock comptometer division , they used vacuum tubes and cold-cathode switching tubes in their logic circuits and nixie tubes for their numerical displays .
they were the first of a series of desktop and hand-held electronic calculators that the company was to develop and sell under the anita name into the mid-1970s .
george washington ??? , 1799 was the first president of the united states 1789 ??? 1797 , the commander-in-chief of the continental army during the american revolutionary war , and one of the founding fathers of
he presided over the convention that drafted the constitution , which replaced the articles of confederation and established the position of president .
washington was elected president as the unanimous choice of the 69 electors in 1788 , and he served two terms in office .
he oversaw the creation of a strong , well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the wars raging in europe , suppressed rebellion , and won acceptance among americans of all types .
his leadership style established many forms and rituals of government that have been used since , such as using a cabinet system and delivering an inaugural address .
further , the peaceful transition from his presidency to the presidency of john adams established a tradition that continues into the 21st century .
washington was hailed as '' father of his country '' even during his lifetime .
washington was born into the provincial gentry of colonial virginia ; his wealthy planter family owned tobacco plantations and slaves .
after both his father and older brother died when he was young , washington became personally and professionally attached to the powerful william fairfax , who promoted his career as a surveyor and soldier .
washington quickly became a senior officer in the colonial forces during the first stages of the french and indian war .
chosen by the second continental congress in 1775 to be commander-in-chief of the continental army in the american revolution , washington managed to force the british out of boston in 1776 , but was defeated and almost captured later that
after crossing the delaware river in the dead of winter , he defeated the british in two battles , retook new jersey and restored momentum to the patriot cause .
because of his strategy , revolutionary forces captured two major british armies at saratoga in 1777 and yorktown in 1781 .
historians laud washington for his selection and supervision of his generals , encouragement of morale and ability to hold together the army , coordination with the state governors and state militia units , relations with congress and attention to supplies
in battle , however , washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by british generals with larger armies .
after victory had been finalized in 1783 , washington resigned as commander-in-chief rather than seize power , proving his opposition to dictatorship and his commitment to american republicanism .
dissatisfied with the weaknesses of the articles of confederation , in 1787 washington presided over the constitutional convention that drafted the united states constitution .
elected unanimously as the first president of the united states in 1789 , he attempted to bring rival factions together to unify the nation .
he supported alexander hamilton 's programs to pay off all state and national debt , to implement an effective tax system and to create a national bank despite opposition from thomas jefferson .
washington proclaimed the united states neutral in the wars raging in europe after 1793 .
he avoided war with great britain and guaranteed a decade of peace and profitable trade by securing the jay treaty in 1795 , despite intense opposition from the jeffersonians .
although never officially joining the federalist party , he supported its programs .
washington 's farewell address was an influential primer on republican virtue and a warning against partisanship , sectionalism , and involvement in foreign wars .
he retired from the presidency in 1797 and returned to his home , mount vernon , and his domestic life where he managed a variety of enterprises .
he freed all his slaves by his final will .
washington had a vision of a great and powerful nation that would be built on republican lines using federal power .
he sought to use the national government to preserve liberty , improve infrastructure , open the western lands , promote commerce , found a permanent capital , reduce regional tensions and promote a spirit of american nationalism .
at his death , washington was eulogized as `` first in war , first in peace , and first in the hearts of his countrymen '' by henry lee .
the federalists made him the symbol of their party but for many years , the jeffersonians continued to distrust his influence and delayed building the washington monument .
as the leader of the first successful revolution against a colonial empire in world history , washington became an international icon for liberation and nationalism , especially in france and latin america .
new guinea also , tok pisin : niugini , dutch : nieuw guinea , and ; historically : papua is the world 's second largest island , after greenland , covering a land area of 786,000 km2 .
located in the southwest pacific ocean , it lies geographically to the east of the malay archipelago , with which it is sometimes included as part of a greater indo-australian archipelago .
geologically it is a part of the same tectonic plate as australia .
when world sea levels were low , the two shared shorelines which now lie 100 to 140 metres below sea level , combining with lands now inundated into the tectonic continent of sahul , also known as greater
the two landmasses became separated when the area now known as the torres strait flooded after the end of the last glacial period .
anthropologically , new guinea is considered part of melanesia .
politically , the western half of the island comprises two indonesian provinces : papua and west papua .
the eastern half forms the mainland of the country of papua new guinea .
the island has a population of about 7.5 million , with a very low population density of only 8 inh\/km2 .
new guinea is differentiated from its drier , flatter , and less fertile southern counterpart , australia , by its much higher rainfall and its active volcanic geology , with its highest point , puncak jaya , reaching an elevation
yet the two land masses share a similar animal fauna , with marsupials , including wallabies and possums , and the egg-laying monotreme , the spiny anteater , or echidna .
other than bats and some two dozen indigenous rodent genera , there are no pre-human indigenous placental mammals .
pigs , several additional species of rats , and the ancestor of the new guinea singing dog were introduced with human colonization .
the human presence on the island dates back at least 40,000 years to the oldest human migrations out of africa .
research indicates that the highlands were an early and independent center of agriculture , with evidence of irrigation going back at least 10,000 years .
because of the time depth of its inhabitation and its highly fractured landscape , an unusually high number of languages are spoken on the island , with some 1,000 languages a figure higher than that of most continents
most are classified as papuan languages , a generally accepted geographical term which a minority of authors hold to be a genetic one .
a number of austronesian languages are spoken on the coast and on offshore islands .
in the 16th century spanish explorers discovered the island and called it nueva guinea .
in recent history western new guinea was included in the dutch east indies colony .
the germans annexed the northern coast of the eastern half of the island as german new guinea in their pre ??? world war i effort to establish themselves as a colonial power , whilst the south eastern portion was reluctantly
following the treaty of versailles , the german portion was awarded to australia which was already governing the british claim , named the territory of papua as a league of nations mandate .
the eastern half of the island was granted independence from australia as papua new guinea in 1975 .
the western half gained independence from the dutch in 1961 , but became part of indonesia soon afterwards in controversial circumstances .

milk is a white liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals .
it is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals before they are able to digest other types of food .
early - lactation milk contains colostrum , which carries the mother 's antibodies to the baby and can reduce the risk of many diseases in the baby .
it also contains many other nutrients .
as an agricultural product , milk is extracted from mammals and used as food for humans .
worldwide , dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011 .
india is the world 's largest producer and consumer of milk , yet neither exports nor imports milk .
new zealand , the european union 's 27 member states , australia , and the united states are the world 's largest exporters of milk and milk products .
china and russia are the world 's largest importers of milk and milk products .
throughout the world , there are more than 6 billion consumers of milk and milk products .
over 750 million people live within dairy farming households .
milk is a key contributor to improving nutrition and food security particularly in developing countries .
improvements in livestock and dairy technology offer significant promise in reducing poverty and malnutrition in the world .
motorcycle speedway , usually referred to as speedway , is a motorcycle sport involving four and sometimes up to six riders competing over four anti-clockwise laps of an oval circuit .
speedway motorcycles use only one gear and have no brakes and racing takes place on a flat oval track usually consisting of dirt or loosely packed shale .
competitors use this surface to slide their machines sideways , powersliding or broadsiding into the bends .
on the straight sections of the track the motorcycles reach speeds of up .
the exact origins of the sport are unknown but there is evidence of a type of speedway racing being practiced in the usa before the first world war and in australia in the late 1910s and early 1920s .
there are now both domestic and international competitions in a number of countries including the speedway world cup whilst the highest overall scoring individual in the speedway grand prix events is pronounced the world champion .
speedway is popular in central and northern europe and to a lesser extent in australia and north america .
a variant of track racing , speedway is administered internationally by the f ?? d ?? ration internationale de motocyclisme fim .
domestic speedway events are regulated by fim affiliated national motor sport federations .

the jews iso 259-3 israeli pronunciation , also known as the jewish people , are a nation and an ethnoreligious group , originating in the israelites or hebrews of the ancient near east .
the jewish ethnicity , nationality , and religion are strongly interrelated , as judaism is the traditional faith of the jewish nation .
converts to judaism , whose status as jews within the jewish ethnos is equal to those born into it , have been absorbed into the jewish people throughout the millennia .
in jewish tradition , jewish ancestry is traced to the biblical patriarchs abraham , isaac and jacob in the second millennium bce .
the modern state of israel was established as a jewish nation-state , and defines itself as such in its basic laws .
its law of return grants the right of citizenship to any jew who requests it .
israel is the only country where jews are a majority of the population .
jews also enjoyed political autonomy twice before in ancient history .
the first of these periods lasted from 1350 to 586 bce , and encompassed the periods of the judges , the united monarchy , and the divided monarchy of the kingdoms of israel and judah , ending with the destruction
the second was the period of the hasmonean kingdom spanning from 140 to 37 bce .
since the destruction of the first temple , most jews have lived in diaspora .
a minority in every country in which they live except israel , they have frequently experienced persecution throughout history , resulting in a population that has fluctuated both in numbers and distribution over the centuries .
the world jewish population reached a peak of 15 million prior to the second world war , but six million jews were killed in the holocaust .
since then the population has risen again and , was estimated at 13.4 million by the north american jewish data bank , or less than 0.2 % of the total world population roughly one in every 514 people
according to this report , about 42.5 % of all jews reside in israel 5.7 million , and 39.3 % in the united states 5.3 million , with most of the remainder living in europe
these numbers include all those who consider themselves jews , whether or not they are affiliated with a jewish organization .
the total world jewish population , however , is difficult to measure .
in addition to issues with census methodology , there are halakhic disputes regarding who is a jew and secular , political , and ancestral identification factors that may affect the figure considerably .

the start of the systematic european colonization of the americas is typically dated to 1492 , when a spanish expedition headed by christopher columbus sailed for india to open trade but inadvertently discovered the americas .
european conquest , large-scale exploration and colonization soon followed .
seeing that europe was preoccupied with many internal wars and was slowly recovering from the many deaths that the bubonic plague caused , the rapid expansion at which it grew in wealth and power was unforeseeable in the early 1400s
the first expeditions occurred along the caribbean coasts on the islands of hispaniola , puerto rico and cuba , and after 1500 extended into the interiors of both north and south america .
in 1497 , sailing from the north on behalf of england , john cabot landed on the north american coast , and a year later , columbus 's third voyage reached the south american coast .
france founded colonies in much of eastern north america , on a number of caribbean islands , and in south america .
portugal colonized brazil .
eventually , the entire western hemisphere came under the control of european governments , leading to profound changes to its landscape , population , and plant and animal life .
in the 19th century alone over 50 million people left europe for the americas .
the post-1492 era is known as the period of the columbian exchange .
testosterone is a steroid hormone from the androgen group and is found in mammals , reptiles , birds , and other vertebrates .
in mammals , testosterone is primarily secreted in the testicles of males and the ovaries of females , although small amounts are also secreted by the adrenal glands .
it is the principal male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid .
in men , testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testis and prostate as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle , bone mass , and the growth of
in addition , testosterone is essential for health and well-being as well as the prevention of osteoporosis .
on average , in adult human males , the plasma concentration of testosterone is about 7 ??? 8 times as great as the concentration in adult human females ' plasma , but as the metabolic consumption of testosterone in males
females also are more sensitive to the hormone .
testosterone is observed in most vertebrates .
fish make a slightly different form called 11-ketotestosterone .
its counterpart in insects is ecdysone .
these ubiquitous steroids suggest that sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history .
cluster sampling is a sampling technique used when `` natural '' but relatively homogeneous groupings are evident in a statistical population .
it is often used in marketing research .
in this technique , the total population is divided into these groups or clusters and a simple random sample of the groups is selected .
then the required information is collected from a simple random sample of the elements within each selected group .
this may be done for every element in these groups or a subsample of elements may be selected within each of these groups .
a common motivation for cluster sampling is to reduce the total number of interviews and costs given the desired accuracy .
assuming a fixed sample size , the technique gives more accurate results when most of the variation in the population is within the groups , not between them .

copper is a chemical element with the symbol cu from and atomic number 29 .
it is a ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity .
pure copper is soft and malleable ; a freshly exposed surface has a reddish-orange color .
it is used as a conductor of heat and electricity , a building material , and a constituent of various metal alloys .
the metal and its alloys have been used for thousands of years .
in the roman era , copper was principally mined on cyprus , hence the origin of the name of the metal as ?? yprium metal of cyprus , later shortened to ?? uprum .
its compounds are commonly encountered as copper ii salts , which often impart blue or green colors to minerals such as azurite and turquoise and have been widely used historically as pigments .
architectural structures built with copper corrode to give green verdigris or patina .
decorative art prominently features copper , both by itself and as part of pigments .
copper is essential to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase .
in molluscs and crustacea copper is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin , which is replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates .
the main areas where copper is found in vertebrates are liver , muscle and bone .
in sufficient concentration , copper compounds are poisonous to higher organisms and are used as bacteriostatic substances , fungicides , and wood preservatives .

established by the virginia company of london as `` james fort '' on may 14 , 1607 o.s. , may 24 , 1607 n.s. , it followed several earlier failed attempts , including the lost colony of roanoke
jamestown served as the capital of the colony for 83 years , from 1616 until 1699 .
the settlement was located within the territory of a political entity known as tsenacommacah , the state of the powhatan confederacy , with around 14,000 native inhabitants , and specifically was in part of the subdivision known as the paspahegh
the natives initially welcomed the colonists with dancing , feasting and tobacco ceremonies , and they provided crucial provisions and support for the survival of the colonists , who were not agriculturally inclined , although relations with the newcomers also
within a year of jamestown 's founding , the virginia company brought polish and dutch colonists to help improve the settlement .
in 1619 , the first documented africans were brought to jamestown , though the modern conception of slavery in the future united states did not begin in virginia until 1660 .
when the colony was subdivided into the original eight shires of virginia in 1634 , the town became located in the eponymous james city shire .
the london company 's second settlement , bermuda , claims to be the site of the oldest town in the english new world , as st. george 's , bermuda was officially established as new london in 1612
in 1699 , the capital was relocated from jamestown to what is today williamsburg , after which jamestown ceased to exist as a settlement , existing today only as an archaeological site .
today , jamestown is one of three locations comprising the historic triangle of colonial virginia , along with williamsburg and yorktown , with two primary heritage sites .
historic jamestowne , the archaeological site on jamestown island , is a cooperative effort by jamestown national historic site part of colonial national historical park , and preservation virginia .

carbon-14 , 14c , or radiocarbon , is a radioactive isotope of carbon with a nucleus containing 6 protons and 8 neutrons .
its presence in organic materials is the basis of the radiocarbon dating method pioneered by willard libby and colleagues 1949 to date archaeological , geological and hydrogeological samples .
carbon-14 was discovered on 27 february 1940 , by martin kamen and sam ruben at the university of california radiation laboratory in berkeley , although its existence had been suggested by franz kurie in 1934 .
there are three naturally occurring isotopes of carbon on earth : 99 % of the carbon is carbon-12 , 1 % is carbon-13 , and carbon-14 occurs in trace amounts , i.e. , making up about 1 part per trillion
the half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730 ?? 40 years .
carbon-14 decays into nitrogen-14 through beta decay .
the primary natural source of carbon-14 on earth is cosmic ray action upon nitrogen in the atmosphere , and it is therefore a cosmogenic nuclide .
however , open-air nuclear testing between 1955 ??? 1980 contributed to this pool .
the different isotopes of carbon do not differ appreciably in their chemical properties .
this is used in chemical and biological research , in a technique called carbon labeling : carbon-14 atoms can be used to replace nonradioactive carbon , in order to trace chemical and biochemical reactions involving carbon atoms from any given
the gunfight at the o.k. corral was a gunfight that took place at about 3:00 p.m. on wednesday , october 26 , 1881 , in tombstone , arizona territory , and is generally regarded as the most famous gunfight in
the gunfight , believed to have lasted only about thirty seconds , was fought between the outlaw cowboys billy claiborne , ike and billy clanton , and tom and frank mclaury , and the opposing town marshal virgil earp and
ike clanton and billy claiborne ran from the fight unharmed , but ike 's brother billy clanton was killed , along with both mclaurys .
lawmen virgil and morgan earp and doc holliday were wounded .
only wyatt earp came through the fight unharmed .
the fight has come to represent a time in american history when the frontier was open range for outlaws opposed by law enforcement that was spread thin over vast territories , leaving some areas unprotected .
the gunfight was not well known to the american public until 1931 when author stuart lake published what has since been determined to be a largely fictionalized biography , wyatt earp : frontier marshal , two years after earp 's
lake retold his story in a 1946 book that director john ford developed into the movie my darling clementine .
after the movie gunfight at the o.k. corral was released in 1957 , the shootout came to be known by that name .
since then , the conflict has been portrayed with varying degrees of accuracy in numerous western films and books .
despite its name , the gunfight actually occurred in a narrow lot six doors west of the rear entrance to the o.k. corral on fremont street , and also in the street .
the two opposing parties were initially only about apart .
about thirty shots were fired in thirty seconds .
ike clanton filed murder charges against the earps and doc holliday but they were eventually exonerated by a local judge after a 30-day preliminary hearing and then again by a local grand jury .
on december 28 , 1881 , virgil earp was maimed in an assassination attempt by the outlaw cowboys , and on march 18 , 1882 , they assassinated morgan earp .
the suspects furnished solid alibis , and newly appointed deputy u.s. marshal wyatt earp took matters into his own hands during the earp vendetta ride , ironically pursued by county sheriff johnny behan with warrants for the earp 's arrest

the english renaissance was a cultural and artistic movement in england dating from the late 15th and early 16th centuries to the early 17th century .
it is associated with the pan-european renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in italy in the late 14th century .
like most of northern europe , england saw little of these developments until more than a century later .
the beginning of the english renaissance is often taken , as a convenience , to be 1485 , when the battle of bosworth field ended the wars of the roses and inaugurated the tudor dynasty .
renaissance style and ideas , however , were slow in penetrating england , and the elizabethan era in the second half of the 16th century is usually regarded as the height of the english renaissance .

mate , ; sometimes also spelled mat ?? , also known as chimarr ?? o or cimarr ?? n , is a traditional south american infused drink , particularly in argentina , uruguay ,
it is prepared from steeping dried leaves of yerba mate llex paraguariensis , known in portuguese as erva-mate in hot water .

the straw is traditionally made of silver .
modern , commercially available straws are typically made of nickel silver , called alpaca ; stainless steel , or hollow-stemmed cane .
the gourd is known as a mate or a guampa ; while in brazil , it has the specific name of cuia , or also caba ?? a the name for indigenous-influenced calabash gourds in other regions of brazil
even if the water is supplied from a modern thermos , the infusion is traditionally drunk from mates or cuias .
as with other brewed herbs , yerba mate leaves are dried , chopped , and ground into a powdery mixture called yerba .
the bombilla acts as both a straw and a sieve .
the submerged end is flared , with small holes or slots that allow the brewed liquid in , but block the chunky matter that makes up much of the mixture .
a modern bombilla design uses a straight tube with holes , or spring sleeve to act as a sieve .

osteonecrosis of the jaw onj is a severe bone disease that affects the maxilla and the mandible .
various forms of onj have been described over the last 160 years , and a number of causes have been suggested in the literature .
osteonecrosis of the jaws associated with bisphosphonate therapy , required by some cancer treatment regimens , has been identified and defined as a pathological entity since 2003 .
the possible risk from lower oral doses of bisphosphonates , taken by patients to prevent or treat osteoporosis , remains uncertain .
various treatment options have been explored , however severe cases of onj still require surgical removal of the affected bone .
a thorough history and assessement of pre-existing systemic problems and possible sites of dental infection are required to help prevent the condition , especially if bisphosphonate therapy is considered .

polyethylene terephthalate sometimes written poly ethylene terephthalate , commonly abbreviated pet , pete , or the obsolete petp or pet-p , is a thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family and is used in synthetic fibers
the term polyethylene terephthalate is a source of confusion because this substance , pet , does not contain polyethylene .
thus , the alternate form , poly ethylene terephthalate , is often used in scholarly journals for the sake of accuracy and clarity .
depending on its processing and thermal history , polyethylene terephthalate may exist both as an amorphous transparent and as a semi-crystalline polymer .
the semicrystalline material might appear transparent particle size 500 nm or opaque and white particle size up to a few microns depending on its crystal structure and particle size .
its monomer bis - ?? - hydroxyterephthalate can be synthesized by the esterification reaction between terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol with water as a byproduct , or by transesterification reaction between ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate with methanol
polymerization is through a polycondensation reaction of the monomers done immediately after esterification\/transesterification with water as the byproduct .
the majority of the world 's pet production is for synthetic fibers in excess of 60 % , with bottle production accounting for around 30 % of global demand .
in the context of textile applications , pet is referred to by its common name , '' polyester , '' whereas the acronym `` pet '' is generally used in relation to packaging .
polyester makes up about 18 % of world polymer production and is the third-most-produced polymer ; polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp are first and second , respectively .
pet consists of polymerized units of the monomer ethylene terephthalate , with repeating c10h8o4 units .
pet is commonly recycled , and has the number `` 1 '' as its recycling symbol .

a leasehold estate is an ownership of a temporary right to hold land or property in which a lessee or a tenant holds rights of real property by some form of title from a lessor or landlord .
although a tenant does hold rights to real property , a leasehold estate is typically considered personal property .
leasehold is a form of land tenure or property tenure where one party buys the right to occupy land or a building for a given length of time .
as lease is a legal estate , leasehold estate can be bought and sold on the open market .
a leasehold thus differs from a freehold or fee simple where the ownership of a property is purchased outright and thereafter held for an indeterminate length of time , and also differs from a tenancy where a property is let
until the end of the lease period often measured in decades or centuries ; a 99 year lease is quite common the leaseholder has the right to remain in occupation as an assured tenant paying an agreed rent
terms of the agreement are contained in a lease , which has elements of contract and property law intertwined .
the term estate for years may occasionally be used .
this refers to a leasehold estate for any specific period of time the word `` years '' is misleading .
an estate for years is not automatically renewed .
colloquially , `` lease '' and '' leasing '' are often a formalization of a longer , specific period as compared with a `` rental '' that created a tenancy at will , terminable or renewable at the end of
the nautical mile symbol m , nm or nmi is a unit of length that is about one minute of arc of latitude measured along any meridian , or about one minute of arc of longitude at the
by international agreement it has been set at 1,852 metres exactly about 6,076 feet .
it is a non - si unit although accepted for use in the international system of units by the bipm used especially by navigators in the shipping and aviation industries , and also in polar exploration .
it is commonly used in international law and treaties , especially regarding the limits of territorial waters .
it developed from the sea mile and the related geographical mile .
the nautical mile remains in use by sea and air navigators worldwide because of its convenience when working with charts .
most nautical charts use the mercator projection whose scale varies by about a factor of six from the equator to 80 ?? latitude , so charts covering large areas can not use a single linear scale .
the nautical mile is nearly equal to a minute of latitude on a chart , so a distance measured with a chart divider can be roughly converted to nautical miles using the chart 's latitude scale .
black hairy tongue bht , also termed lingua villosa nigra refers to a condition of the tongue where the filiform papillae elongate with black or brown discoloration , giving a black and hairy appearance .

management is by improving oral hygiene , especially scraping or brushing the tongue .
the ieee 1394 interface is a serial bus interface standard for high-speed communications and isochronous real-time data transfer .
it was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s by apple , who called it firewire .
the 1394 interface is comparable to usb , and often those two technologies are considered together , though usb has more market share .
apple first included firewire in some of its 1999 models , and most apple computers since the year 2000 have included firewire ports , though , as of 2013 , nothing beyond the 800 version ieee-1394b .
the interface is also known by the brand i. link sony , and lynx texas instruments .
ieee 1394 replaced parallel scsi in many applications , because of lower implementation costs and a simplified , more adaptable cabling system .
the 1394 standard also defines a backplane interface , though this is not as widely used .
ieee 1394 is the high-definition audio-video network alliance hana standard connection interface for a\/v audio\/visual component communication and control .
firewire is also available in wireless , fiber optic , and coaxial versions using the isochronous protocols .

bubbles born 1983 is a common chimpanzee , known for being the one-time pet of american recording artist michael jackson , who bought the primate from a texas research facility in the early 1980s .
the animal was a frequent travel companion to the singer , whose attachment to the animal led to media mockery and , among other factors , to a public perception of jackson as an eccentric .

the history of the internet began with the development of electronic computers in the 1950s .
the public was first introduced to the concepts that would lead to the internet when a message was sent over the arpanet from computer science professor leonard kleinrock 's laboratory at university of california , los angeles ucla
packet switched networks such as arpanet , mark i at npl in the uk , cyclades , merit network , tymnet , and telenet , were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of protocols .
the arpanet in particular led to the development of protocols for internetworking , in which multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks .
in 1982 , the internet protocol suite tcp\/ip was standardized , and consequently , the concept of a world-wide network of interconnected tcp\/ip networks , called the internet , was introduced .
access to the arpanet was expanded in 1981 when the national science foundation nsf developed the computer science network csnet and again in 1986 when nsfnet provided access to supercomputer sites in the united states from
commercial internet service providers isps began to emerge in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
the arpanet was decommissioned in 1990 .
the internet was commercialized in 1995 when nsfnet was decommissioned , removing the last restrictions on the use of the internet to carry commercial traffic .
since the mid-1990s , the internet has had a revolutionary impact on culture and commerce , including the rise of near-instant communication by electronic mail , instant messaging , voice over internet protocol voip `` phone calls ''
the research and education community continues to develop and use advanced networks such as nsf 's very high speed backbone network service vbns , internet2 , and national lambdarail .
increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-gbit\/s , 10-gbit\/s , or more .
the internet 's takeover over the global communication landscape was almost instant in historical terms : it only communicated 1 % of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications networks in the year 1993 , already 51 % by 2000 ,
today the internet continues to grow , driven by ever greater amounts of online information , commerce , entertainment , and social networking .
rolling rock is a 4.6 % abv pale lager launched in 1939 by the latrobe brewing company .
although founded as a local beer in western pennsylvania , it was marketed aggressively and eventually became a national product .
the brand was sold to anheuser-busch of st. louis , missouri , in mid 2006 , which transferred brewing operations to new jersey .

he was originally a liberal theologian , but adopted conservative views after 1968 .
his prolific writings defend traditional catholic doctrine and values .
during his papacy , benedict xvi advocated a return to fundamental christian values to counter the increased secularisation of many western countries .
he views relativism 's denial of objective truth , and the denial of moral truths in particular , as the central problem of the 21st century .
he taught the importance of both the catholic church and an understanding of god 's redemptive love .
pope benedict also revived a number of traditions including elevating the tridentine mass to a more prominent position .
he renewed the relationship between the catholic church and art , viewing the use of beauty as a path to the sacred , promoted the use of latin , and reintroduced traditional papal garments , for which reason he was
he has been described as `` the main intellectual force in the church '' since the mid-1980s .
several of pope benedict 's students from his academic career are also prominent churchmen today and confidantes of him , notably christoph sch ?? nborn .
on 11 february 2013 , pope benedict announced his resignation in a speech in latin before the cardinals , citing a `` lack of strength of mind and body '' due to his advanced age .

john adams october 30 , 1735 o.s. october 19 , 1735 ??? july 4 , 1826 was the second president of the united states 1797 ??? 1801 , having earlier served as the first
an american founding father , he was a statesman , diplomat , and a leading advocate of american independence from great britain .
well educated , he was an enlightenment political theorist who promoted republicanism and wrote prolifically about his often seminal ideas , both in published works and in letters to his wife and key adviser abigail as well as to other
adams came to prominence in the early stages of the american revolution .
a lawyer and public figure in boston , as a delegate from massachusetts to the continental congress , he played a leading role in persuading congress to declare independence .
he assisted thomas jefferson in drafting the declaration of independence in 1776 , and was its primary advocate in the congress .
later , as a diplomat in europe , he helped negotiate the eventual peace treaty with great britain , and was responsible for obtaining vital governmental loans from amsterdam bankers .
a political theorist and historian , adams largely wrote the massachusetts constitution in 1780 , which together with his earlier thoughts on government , influenced american political thought .
one of his greatest roles was as a judge of character : in 1775 , he nominated george washington to be commander-in-chief , and 25 years later nominated john marshall to be chief justice of the united states .
adams ' revolutionary credentials secured him two terms as george washington 's vice president and his own election in 1796 as the second president .
during his one term , he encountered ferocious attacks by the jeffersonian republicans , as well as the dominant faction in his own federalist party led by his bitter enemy alexander hamilton .
adams signed the controversial alien and sedition acts , and built up the army and navy especially in the face of an undeclared naval war called the '' quasi-war '' with france , 1798 ??? 1800 .
the major accomplishment of his presidency was his peaceful resolution of the conflict in the face of hamilton 's opposition .
in 1800 , adams was defeated for re-election by thomas jefferson and retired to massachusetts .
he later resumed his friendship with jefferson .
he and his wife , abigail adams , founded an accomplished family line of politicians , diplomats , and historians now referred to as the adams political family .
adams was the father of john quincy adams , the sixth president of the united states .
his achievements have received greater recognition in modern times , though his contributions were not initially as celebrated as those of other founders .
adams was the first u.s. president to reside in the building that eventually became known as the white house .

a jetboat is a boat propelled by a jet of water ejected from the back of the craft .
unlike a powerboat or motorboat that uses a propeller in the water below or behind the boat , a jetboat draws the water from under the boat into a pump inside the boat , then expels it through a nozzle
jetboats were originally designed by sir william hamilton who developed a waterjet in 1954 for operation in the fast-flowing and shallow rivers of new zealand , specifically to overcome the problem of propellers striking rocks in such waters
previous attempts at waterjet propulsion had very short lifetimes , generally due to the inefficient design of the units and the fact that they offered few advantages over conventional propellers .
unlike these previous waterjet developments , such as campini 's and the hanley hydrojet , hamilton had a specific need for a propulsion system to operate in very-shallow water , and the waterjet proved to be the ideal solution .
from this , the popularity of the jet unit and jetboat increased rapidly .
through further developments , it was found the waterjet offered several other advantages over propellers for a wide range of vessel types , and as such , waterjets are used widely today for many high-speed vessels , including passenger ferries
jetboats are highly maneuverable , and many can , from full speed , be reversed and brought to a stop within little more than their own length , in a maneuver known as a `` crash stop '' .
the well known hamilton turn or `` jet spin '' is a high-speed maneuvre where the boat 's engine throttle is cut , the steering is turned sharply and the throttle opened again , causing the boat to spin quickly
there is no engineering limit to the size of jetboats , though the validity of their use depends a lot on the type of application .
classic prop-drives are generally more efficient and economical at low speeds , up to about , but as boat speed increases beyond this , the extra hull resistance generated by struts , rudders , shafts etc. means waterjets
also , in situations with very large propellers turning at slow speeds such as tug boats , the equivalent size waterjet would be too big to be practical .
for these reasons , the vast majority of waterjet units are installed in high-speed vessels and in particular situations where shallow draught , maneuverability , and load flexibility are main concerns .
the biggest jet-driven vessels are found in military use or the high-speed passenger\/car ferry industry .
south africa 's s approximately long are the biggest jet-propelled vessels so far .
even these german-built vessels are capable of performing `` crash stops '' .

tea party protesters on the west lawn of the u.s. capitol and the national mall at the taxpayer march on washington on september 12 , 2009 .
the tea party movement is an american political movement that advocates strict adherence to the united states constitution , reducing u.s. government spending and taxes , and reduction of the u.s. national debt and federal budget deficit .
the movement has been called partly conservative , partly libertarian , and partly populist .
the movement has sponsored protests and supported political candidates since 2009 .
the name of the movement is derived from the boston tea party of 1773 , an iconic event in american history .
anti-tax protesters in the united states have often referred to the original boston tea party for inspiration .
references to the boston tea party were part of tax day protests held throughout the 1990s and earlier .
by 2001 , a custom had developed among some conservative activists of mailing tea bags to legislators and other officials as a symbolic act .
the currencies of puerto rico closely follow the historic development of puerto rico .
as a colony of spain and the united states , puerto rico was granted the use of both foreign and provincial currencies .
following the spanish colonization in 1502 , puerto rico became an important port , with its own supply of gold .
however , as the mineral reserves ran empty within the century , the archipelago 's economy suffered .
the spanish crown issued the situado mexicano , which meant that a semi-regular shipment of gold from the viceroyalty of new spain would be sent to the island , as a way to provide economic support .
between 1636 and 1637 , philip iv of spain imposed a tax which had to be paid using a revenue stamp .
inspired by this , puerto rico began producing banknotes in 1766 , becoming the first colony to print 8 - real banknotes in the spanish empire and which in the spanish government 's approval of subsequent issues .
the situado was discontinued during the 19th century , creating an economic crisis , as a result of mexico gaining its independence from spain .
salvador mel ?? ndez bruna , the colonial governor in office , ordered the issue of provincial banknotes , creating the puerto rican peso .
however , printing of these banknotes ceased after 1815 .
during the following decades , foreign coins became the widespread currency .
in the 1860s and 1870s , banknotes reemerged .
on february 1 , 1890 , the banco espa ?? ol de puerto rico was inaugurated and began issuing banknotes .
the bank designed four series and placed three in circulation under spanish rule .
in 1895 , a royal decree ordered the production of provincial peso coins .
on august 13 , 1898 , the spanish-american war ended with spain ceding puerto rico to the united states .
the banco espa ?? ol de puerto rico was renamed bank of porto rico and issued bills equivalent to the united states dollar , creating the puerto rican dollar .
in 1902 , the first national bank of porto rico issued banknotes in a parallel manner .
two more series were issued until 1913 .
after puerto rico 's economy and monetary system was fully integrated into the united states ' economic and monetary system , the puerto rican dollars were redeemed for those issued by the united states treasury .
the peso and dollar have been followed by other contemporary issues , including commemorative banknotes , private currency , and a quarter coin designed with fort san felipe del morro in the face .
the book of ezekiel is the third of the latter prophets in the hebrew bible , following the books of isaiah and jeremiah and preceding the book of the twelve .
-lrb- the order is somewhat different in the christian old testament .
it derives its name from , and records the visions of , the 6th century bc priest and prophet ezekiel .
according to the book , the prophet , exiled in babylon , experienced a series of seven visions during the 22 years from 593 to 571 bc , a period which spans the final destruction of jerusalem in 586 .
the visions , and the book , are structured around three themes : 1 judgment on israel chapters 1-24 ; 2 judgment on the nations chapters 25-32 ; and future blessings for
this 1768 parchment 612 ?? 502 mm by jekuthiel sofer emulated the 1675 ten commandments at the amsterdam esnoga synagogue .
the ten commandments , also known as the decalogue , are a set of biblical laws relating to ethics and worship , which play a fundamental role in judaism , islam and christianity .
they include instructions to worship only god , to keep the sabbath holy and prohibitions against idolatry , blasphemy , murder , theft , deception and adultery .
different groups follow slightly different traditions for interpreting and numbering them .
the ten commandments appear twice in the hebrew bible , in the books of exodus and deuteronomy .
according to the story in exodus , god inscribed them on two stone tablets , which he gave to moses on mount sinai .
modern scholarship has found likely influences in hittite and mesopotamian laws and treaties , but is divided over exactly when the ten commandments were written and who wrote them .

the panda ailuropoda melanoleuca , lit .
`` black and white cat-foot '' , also known as the giant panda to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda , is a bear native to central-western and south western china .
it is easily recognized by the large , distinctive black patches around its eyes , over the ears , and across its round body .
though it belongs to the order carnivora , the panda 's diet is 99 % bamboo .
pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses , wild tubers , or even meat in the form of birds , rodents or carrion .
in captivity , they may receive honey , eggs , fish , yams , shrub leaves , oranges , or bananas along with specially prepared food .
the giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central china , mainly in sichuan province , but also in the shaanxi and gansu provinces .
as a result of farming , deforestation and other development , the panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived .
the panda is a conservation reliant endangered species .
a 2007 report shows 239 pandas living in captivity inside china and another 27 outside the country .
wild population estimates vary ; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild , while a 2006 study via dna analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000 .
some reports also show that the number of pandas in the wild is on the rise .
however , the iucn does not believe there is enough certainty yet to reclassify the species from endangered to vulnerable .
while the dragon has often served as china 's national emblem , internationally the panda appears at least as commonly .
as such , it is becoming widely used within china in international contexts , for example the five fuwa mascots of the beijing olympics .

the super bowl is the annual championship game of the national football league nfl , the highest level of professional american football in the united states , culminating a season that begins in the late summer of the
the super bowl uses roman numerals to identify each game , rather than the year in which it is held .
for example , super bowl i was played on january 15 , 1967 , following the 1966 regular season , while super bowl xlvii was played on february 3 , 2013 , following the 2012 season .
the game was created as part of a merger agreement between the nfl and its then-rival league , the american football league afl .
it was agreed that the two leagues ' champion teams would play in an afl ??? nfl world championship game until the merger was to officially begin in 1970 .
after the merger , each league was redesignated as a '' conference '' , and the game was then played between the conference champions .
currently , the national football conference nfc leads the series with 25 wins to 22 wins for the american football conference afc .
the day on which the super bowl is played , now considered by some a de facto american national holiday , is called '' super bowl sunday '' .

many languages are used , or historically have been used in the united states .
the most commonly used language is english .
there are also many languages indigenous to north america or to u.s. states or holdings in the pacific region .
languages brought to the country by colonists or immigrants from europe , asia , or other parts of the world make up a large portion of the languages currently used ; several languages , including creoles and sign languages ,
approximately 337 languages are spoken or signed by the population , of which 176 are indigenous to the area .
fifty-two languages formerly spoken in the country 's territory are now extinct .
the variety of english spoken in the united states is known as american english .
english is the de facto national language of the united states , with 80 % of the population claiming it as a mother tongue , and some 95 % claiming to speak it `` well '' or `` very well
however , no official language exists at the federal level .
there have been several proposals to make english the national language in amendments to immigration reform bills , but none of these bills has become law with the amendment intact .
the situation is quite varied at the state and territorial levels , with some states mirroring the federal policy of adopting no official language in a de jure capacity , others adopting english alone , others officially adopting english as
spanish is the second most common language in the country , and is spoken by over 12 % of the population .
the united states holds the world 's fifth largest spanish-speaking population , outnumbered only by mexico , spain , colombia , and argentina .
throughout the southwestern united states , long-established spanish-speaking communities coexist with large numbers of more recent hispanophone immigrants .
although many new latin american immigrants are less than fluent in english , nearly all second-generation hispanic americans speak english fluently , while only about half still speak spanish .
according to the 2000 us census , people of german ancestry make up the largest single ethnic group in the united states , and the german language ranks fifth .
italian , polish , and french are still widely spoken among populations descending from immigrants from those countries in the early 20th century , but the use of these languages is dwindling as the older generations die .
russian is also spoken by immigrant populations .
tagalog and vietnamese have over one million speakers each in the united states , almost entirely within recent immigrant populations .
both languages , along with the varieties of the chinese language , japanese , and korean , are now used in elections in alaska , california , hawaii , illinois , new york , texas , and washington .
native american languages are spoken in smaller pockets of the country , but these populations are decreasing , and the languages are almost never widely used outside of reservations .
hawaiian , although having few native speakers , is an official language along with english at the state level in hawaii .

1990 's pontiac grand am sedan fender and quarter panel
on an automobile , a quarter panel or rear wing as it is known in british english is usually considered the body panel which goes between the rear door and the trunk and typically wraps around the wheel
the quarter panel is typically made of sheet metal , but is sometimes made of fiberglass or fiber-reinforced plastic ; although , this varies with different makes and models .
a quarter panel is typically a welded on component of the uni-body structure or monocoque .
replacement of a sheet metal quarter panel typically requires it to be cut off the vehicle and a replacement part to be welded or sometimes bonded to the vehicle .
due to this high amount of specialized labor , a quarter panel may often be repaired rather than replaced by hammering out the damage , and a body filler sometimes referred to as bondo to be applied to finalize the
shropshire or ; alternatively salop ; abbreviated , in print only , shrops is a county in the west midlands region of england .

a unitary authority shropshire council was created on 1 april 2009 , taking over from the previous county council and 5 district councils , and covers most of the county .
the borough of telford and wrekin has been a separate unitary authority since 1998 but continues to be included in the ceremonial county .
the county 's population and economy is centred on five towns : the county town of shrewsbury , which is culturally and historically important and is located in the center of the county ; telford , a new town in
the county has many further market towns , including whitchurch in the north , newport just to the north-east of telford , and market drayton in the north-east of the county .
the ironbridge gorge area is a unesco world heritage site , covering ironbridge , coalbrookdale and a part of madeley .
there are , additionally , other notable historic industrial sites located around the county , such as at shrewsbury , broseley , snailbeach and highley as well as the shropshire union canal .
the shropshire hills area of outstanding natural beauty covers about a quarter of the county , mainly in the south .
shropshire is one of england 's most rural and sparsely populated counties , with the population density of the shropshire council area being just 91\/km2 337\/sq mi .
the wrekin is one of the most famous natural landmarks in the county , though the highest hills are the clee hills , stiperstones and the long mynd .
wenlock edge is another significant geographical and geological landmark .
in the low-lying northwest of the county and overlapping the border with wales is the fenn 's , whixall and bettisfield mosses national nature reserve , one of the most important and best preserved bogs in britain .
the river severn , great britain 's longest river , runs through the county , exiting into worcestershire via the severn valley .
shropshire is landlocked , and with an area of , is england 's largest inland county .
the county flower is the round-leaved sundew .
for eurostat purposes , the county less the unitary district of telford and wrekin is a nuts 3 region code ukg22 .

a value added tax vat is a form of consumption tax .
from the perspective of the buyer , it is a tax on the purchase price .
from that of the seller , it is a tax only on the value added to a product , material , or service , from an accounting point of view , by this stage of its manufacture or distribution .
the manufacturer remits to the government the difference between these two amounts , and retains the rest for themselves to offset the taxes they had previously paid on the inputs .
the value added to a product by or with a business is the sale price charged to its customer , minus the cost of materials and other taxable inputs .
a vat is like a sales tax in that ultimately only the end consumer is taxed .
it differs from the sales tax in that , with the latter , the tax is collected and remitted to the government only once , at the point of purchase by the end consumer .
with the vat , collections , remittances to the government , and credits for taxes already paid occur each time a business in the supply chain purchases products .
a referee calling a high-sticking penaltyhigh
- sticking is the name of two infractions in the sport of ice hockey that may occur when a player intentionally or inadvertently plays with his or her stick above the height of the shoulders or above the cross bar
this can result in a stoppage of play or in a penalty .
in the rules of the national hockey league , high-sticking is defined as a penalty in rule 60 and as a non-penalty foul in rule 80 .
a stoppage in play results if a high stick comes in contact with the puck and the team who touched it regains control of the puck .
however , play usually continues if a player touches the puck with a high stick and the opposing team gains control of the puck .
if the puck goes into the opposing net after coming into contact with a high stick , the goal is disallowed .
the level at which a stick is considered too high for a goal is the crossbar of the net .
however , if a player knocks the puck into his own net with a high stick , the goal is allowed .
a penalty is assessed if a player strikes another player with a high stick .
the player is given a minor penalty unless his high stick caused an injury , in which case the referee has the option to assess a double-minor , major or match penalty .
it is the referee 's discretion which penalty to assess : the rule calls for a double minor for an accidental injury , or a match penalty for a deliberate attempt to injure whether the opposition player was actually
injury is usually decided by the high stick causing bleeding , but the presence of blood does not automatically mean an extra penalty is awarded .
some referees have been known to award an extra penalty without the presence of blood if the referee determines that the injury sustained was sufficient to warrant a double-minor penalty .

a memory card reader is a device , typically having a usb interface , for accessing the data on a memory card such as a compactflash cf , secure digital sd or multimediacard mmc
most card readers also offer write capability , and together with the card , this can function as a pen drive .
some printers and personal computers have a built-in card reader .
a multi card reader is used for communication with more than one type of flash memory card .
multi card readers do not have built-in memory capacity , but are able to accept multiple types and styles of memory cards .
the number of compatible memory cards varies from reader to reader and can include more than 20 different types .
the number of different memory cards that a multi card reader can accept is expressed as x-in-1 , with x being a figure of merit indicating the number of memory cards accepted , such as 35-in-1 .
there are three categories of card readers sorted by the type and quantity of the card slots : single card reader e.g. 1x sd-only , multi card reader e.g. 9-in-1 and series card reader e.g.
some kinds of memory cards with their own usb functions do not need the card reader , such as the intelligent stick memory card , which can plug directly into a usb slot .
the usb device class used is 0x08 .
in greek mythology , the trojan war was waged against the city of troy by the achaeans greeks after paris of troy took helen from her husband menelaus king of sparta .
the war is one of the most important events in greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of greek literature , most notably through homer 's iliad and the odyssey .
the iliad relates a part of the last year of the siege of troy ; the odyssey describes odysseus 's journey home .
other parts of the war are contained in a cycle of epic poems , which have survived through fragments .
episodes from the war provided material for greek tragedy and other works of greek literature , and for roman poets including virgil and ovid .
the war originated from a quarrel between the goddesses athena , hera , and aphrodite , after eris , the goddess of strife and discord , gave them a golden apple , sometimes known as the apple of discord ,
zeus sent the goddesses to paris , who judged that aphrodite , as the `` fairest '' , should receive the apple .
in exchange , aphrodite made helen , the most beautiful of all women and wife of menelaus , fall in love with paris , who took her to troy .
agamemnon , king of mycenae and the brother of helen 's husband menelaus , led an expedition of achaean troops to troy and besieged the city for ten years because of paris ' insult .
after the deaths of many heroes , including the achaeans achilles and ajax , and the trojans hector and paris , the city fell to the ruse of the trojan horse .
the achaeans slaughtered the trojans except for some of the women and children whom they kept or sold as slaves and desecrated the temples , thus earning the gods ' wrath .
few of the achaeans returned safely to their homes and many founded colonies in distant shores .
the romans later traced their origin to aeneas , one of the trojans , who was said to have led the surviving trojans to modern-day italy .
the ancient greeks thought that the trojan war was a historical event that had taken place in the 13th or 12th century bc , and believed that troy was located in modern-day turkey near the dardanelles .
by modern times , both the war and the city were widely believed to be non-historical .
in 1868 , however , the german archaeologist heinrich schliemann met frank calvert , who convinced schliemann that troy was at hissarlik and schliemann took over calvert 's excavations on property belonging to calvert ; this claim is now accepted
whether there is any historical reality behind the trojan war is an open question .
many scholars believe that there is a historical core to the tale , though this may simply mean that the homeric stories are a fusion of various tales of sieges and expeditions by mycenaean greeks during the bronze age .
those who believe that the stories of the trojan war are derived from a specific historical conflict usually date it to the 12th or 11th centuries bc , often preferring the dates given by eratosthenes , 1194 ??? 1184 bc

passover , or pesach from : in hebrew , yiddish , tiberian : , modern hebrew : \/ ?? pesa ?? \/ pesah , pesakh , yiddish : peysekh , paysakh , paysokh is an important biblically
historically , together with shavuot `` pentecost '' and sukkot `` tabernacles '' , passover is one of the three pilgrimage festivals shalosh regalim during which the entire population of the kingdom of judah
samaritans still make this pilgrimage to mount gerizim , but only men participate in public worship .
passover commences on the 15th of the hebrew month of nisan and lasts for either seven days in israel or eight days in the diaspora .
in judaism , a day commences at dusk and lasts until the following dusk , thus the first day of passover only begins after dusk of the 14th of nisan and ends at dusk of the 15th day of the
the rituals unique to the passover celebrations commence with the passover seder when the 15th of nisan has begun .
in the northern hemisphere passover takes place in spring as the torah prescribes it : `` in the month of the spring '' ???????? ?????????? .
it is one of the most widely observed jewish holidays .
the jewish people celebrate passover as a commemoration of their liberation over 3,300 years ago by god from slavery in ancient egypt that was ruled by the pharaohs , and their birth as a nation under the leadership of moses
it commemorates the story of the exodus as described in the hebrew bible especially in the book of exodus , in which the israelites were freed from slavery in egypt .
in the narrative of the exodus , the bible tells that god helped the children of israel escape from their slavery in egypt by inflicting ten plagues upon the ancient egyptians before the pharaoh would release his israelite slaves ;
the israelites were instructed to mark the doorposts of their homes with the blood of a slaughtered spring lamb and , upon seeing this , the spirit of the lord knew to pass over the first-born in these homes ,
there is some debate over where the term is actually derived from .
when the pharaoh freed the israelites , it is said that they left in such a hurry that they could not wait for bread dough to rise leaven .
in commemoration , for the duration of passover no leavened bread is eaten , for which reason it is called `` the festival of the unleavened bread '' .
thus matzo flat unleavened bread is eaten during passover and it is a symbol of the holiday .
halley 's comet or comet halley or , officially designated 1p\/halley , is the best-known of the short-period comets and is visible from earth every 75 ??? 76 years .
halley is the only short-period comet that is clearly visible to the naked eye from earth , and thus the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime .
other naked-eye comets may be brighter and more spectacular , but will appear only once in thousands of years .
halley 's returns to the inner solar system have been observed and recorded by astronomers since at least 240 bce .
clear records of the comet 's appearances were made by chinese , babylonian , and medieval european chroniclers , but were not recognized as reappearances of the same object at the time .
the comet 's periodicity was first determined in 1705 by english astronomer edmond halley , after whom it is now named .
halley 's comet last appeared in the inner solar system in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061 .
during its 1986 apparition , halley became the first comet to be observed in detail by spacecraft , providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation .
these observations supported a number of longstanding hypotheses about comet construction , particularly fred whipple 's `` dirty snowball '' model , which correctly predicted that halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices ??? such as water
the missions also provided data which substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas ; for instance it is now understood that halley 's surface is largely composed of dusty , non-volatile materials , and that only a small portion of it
the soybean us or soya bean uk glycine max is a species of legume native to east asia , widely grown for its edible bean which has numerous uses .
the plant is classed as an oilseed rather than a pulse by the un food and agricultural organization fao .
fat-free defatted soybean meal is a significant and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many prepackaged meals ; soy vegetable oil is another product of processing the soybean crop .
for example , soybean products such as textured vegetable protein tvp are ingredients in many meat and dairy analogs .
soybeans produce significantly more protein per acre than most other uses of land .
traditional nonfermented food uses of soybeans include soy milk , and from the latter tofu and tofu skin .
fermented foods include soy sauce , fermented bean paste , natto , and tempeh , among others .
the oil is used in many industrial applications .
the main producers of soy are the united states 35 % , brazil 27 % , argentina 19 % , china 6 % and india 4 % .
the beans contain significant amounts of phytic acid , alpha-linolenic acid , and isoflavones .

early captchas such as these , generated by the ez-gimpy program , were used on yahoo !
a modern captcha , rather than attempting to create a distorted background and high levels of warping on the text , might focus on making segmentation difficult by adding an angled line .
another way to make segmentation difficult is to crowd symbols together , as in yahoo ! 's current captcha format .
some captchas try to utilize the ability of people to see three-dimensional objects .
on this image , symbols are drawn with lines of different thickness to make an effect of extrusion .
a captcha is a type of challenge-response test used in computing as an attempt to ensure that the response is generated by a human being .
the process usually involves a computer asking a user to complete a simple test which the computer is able to grade .
these tests are designed to be easy for a computer to generate but difficult for a computer to solve , but again easy for a human .
if a correct solution is received , it can be presumed to have been entered by a human .
a common type of captcha requires the user to type letters and\/or digits from a distorted image that appears on the screen .
such tests are commonly used to prevent unwanted internet bots from accessing websites , since a normal human can easily read a captcha , while the bot can not process the image letters and therefore , can not answer properly
although most captchas are letter pictures randomly generated , many of them have become difficult even for a human to read , so picture captchas were created in which a human is shown a simple test to show a picture
the term `` captcha '' was coined in 2000 by luis von ahn , manuel blum , nicholas j. hopper , and john langford all of carnegie mellon university .
it is an acronym based on the word `` capture '' and standing for `` completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart '' .
carnegie mellon university attempted to trademark the term on 15 october 2004 , but the trademark application was abandoned on 21 april 2008 .
a captcha is sometimes described as a reverse turing test , because it is administered by a machine and targeted at a human , in contrast to the standard turing test that is typically administered by a human and targeted

non-binding arbitration is a type of arbitration in which the arbitrator makes a determination of the rights of the parties to the dispute , but this determination is not binding upon them , and no enforceable arbitration award is issued
the `` award '' is in effect an advisory opinion of the arbitrator 's view of the respective merits of the parties cases .
non-binding arbitration is used in connection with attempts to reach a negotiated settlement .
the role of an arbitrator in non-binding arbitration is , on the surface , similar to that of a mediator in a mediation .
however , the principal distinction is that whereas a mediator will try to help the parties find a middle ground to compromise at , the arbitrator remains totally removed from the settlement process and will only give a determination of
subsequent to a non-binding arbitration , the parties remain free to pursue their claims either through the courts , or by way of a binding arbitration , although in practice a settlement is the most common outcome .
the award and reasoning in a non-binding arbitration is almost invariably inadmissible in any subsequent action in the courts or in another arbitration tribunal .
non-binding arbitration is utilised mostly in the united states and canada .
it is largely unknown in europe , although in the united kingdom there is a practice of parties who are seeking a settlement to jointly instruct a queen 's counsel for an opinion on the merits and likely quantum of

a web hosting service is a type of internet hosting service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the world wide web .
web hosts are companies that provide space on a server owned or leased for use by clients , as well as providing internet connectivity , typically in a data center .
web hosts can also provide data center space and connectivity to the internet for other servers located in their data center , called colocation , also known as housing in latin america or france .
the scope of web hosting services varies greatly .
the most basic is web page and small-scale file hosting , where files can be uploaded via file transfer protocol ftp or a web interface .
the files are usually delivered to the web `` as is '' or with minimal processing .
many internet service providers isps offer this service free to subscribers .
individuals and organizations may also obtain web page hosting from alternative service providers .
personal web site hosting is typically free , advertisement-sponsored , or inexpensive .
business web site hosting often has a higher expense depending upon the size and type of the website .
single page hosting is generally sufficient for personal web pages .

conventional pci pci is an initialism formed from peripheral component interconnect , part of the pci local bus standard and often shortened to just pci is a local computer bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer .
the pci bus supports the functions found on a processor bus , but in a standardized format that is independent of any particular processor .
devices connected to the bus appear to the processor to be connected directly to the processor bus , and are assigned addresses in the processor 's address space .
attached devices can take either the form of an integrated circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself , called a planar device in the pci specification , or an expansion card that fits into a slot .
the pci local bus was first implemented in ibm pc compatibles , where it displaced the combination of isa plus one vesa local bus as the bus configuration .
it has subsequently been adopted for other computer types .
pci and pci-x are being replaced by pci express , but , most motherboards are still made with one or more pci slots , which are sufficient for many uses .
the pci specification covers the physical size of the bus including the size and spacing of the circuit board edge electrical contacts , electrical characteristics , bus timing , and protocols .
the specification can be purchased from the pci special interest group pci-sig .
typical pci cards used in pcs include : network cards , sound cards , modems , extra ports such as usb or serial , tv tuner cards and disk controllers .
pci video cards replaced isa and vesa cards , until growing bandwidth requirements outgrew the capabilities of pci ; the preferred interface for video cards became agp , and then pci express .
pci video cards remain available for use with old pcs without agp or pci express slots .
many devices previously provided on pci expansion cards are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in universal serial bus and pci express versions .

55 '' lg oled tv showcased at ces 2012
prototype oled lighting panel developed by lumiotec
demonstration of a flexible oled device
an oled organic light-emitting diode is a light-emitting diode led in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound which emits light in response to an electric current .
this layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes .
generally , at least one of these electrodes is transparent .
oleds are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens , computer monitors , portable systems such as mobile phones , handheld games consoles and pdas .
a major area of research is the development of white oled devices for use in solid-state lighting applications .
there are two main families of oleds : those based on small molecules and those employing polymers .
adding mobile ions to an oled creates a light-emitting electrochemical cell or lec , which has a slightly different mode of operation .
oled displays can use either passive-matrix pmoled or active-matrix addressing schemes .
active-matrix oleds amoled require a thin-film transistor backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off , but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes .
an oled display works without a backlight .
thus , it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display lcd .
in low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an oled screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an lcd , whether the lcd uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or led backlight .

this ranges from arteries serving the brain to those bringing blood to the lungs , kidneys , arms and legs .
methylcobalamin shown is a form of vitamin b12 .
physically it resembles the other forms of vitamin b12 , occurring as dark red crystals that freely form cherry-colored transparent solutions in water .
vitamin b12 , vitamin b12 or vitamin b-12 , also called cobalamin , is a water-soluble vitamin with a key role in the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system , and for the formation of blood .
it is one of the eight b vitamins .
it is normally involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body , especially affecting dna synthesis and regulation , but also fatty acid synthesis and energy production .
neither fungi , plants , nor animals are capable of producing vitamin b12 .
only bacteria and archaea have the enzymes required for its synthesis , although many foods are a natural source of b12 because of bacterial symbiosis .
the vitamin is the largest and most structurally complicated vitamin and can be produced industrially only through bacterial fermentation-synthesis .
vitamin b12 consists of a class of chemically related compounds vitamers , all of which have vitamin activity .
it contains the biochemically rare element cobalt .
biosynthesis of the basic structure of the vitamin is accomplished only by bacteria which usually produce hydroxocobalamin , but conversion between different forms of the vitamin can be accomplished in the human body .
a common semi-synthetic form of the vitamin , cyanocobalamin , does not occur in nature , but is produced from bacterial hydroxocobalamin and then used in many pharmaceuticals and supplements , and as a food additive , because of its
in the body it is converted to the human physiological forms methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin , leaving behind the cyanide , albeit in minimal concentration .
more recently , hydroxocobalamin , methylcobalamin , and adenosylcobalamin can be found in more expensive pharmacological products and food supplements .
the extra utility of these is currently debated .
vitamin b12 was discovered from its relationship to the disease pernicious anemia , which is an autoimmune disease in which parietal cells of the stomach responsible for secreting intrinsic factor are destroyed .
intrinsic factor is crucial for the normal absorption of b12 , so a lack of intrinsic factor , as seen in pernicious anemia , causes a vitamin b12 deficiency .
many other subtler kinds of vitamin b12 deficiency and their biochemical effects have since been elucidated .

hydrogen is a chemical element with symbol h and atomic number 1 .
with an atomic weight of for hydrogen-1 , hydrogen is the lightest element and its monatomic form h1 is the most abundant chemical substance , constituting roughly 75 % of the universe 's baryonic mass .
non - remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state .
at standard temperature and pressure , hydrogen is a colorless , odorless , tasteless , non-toxic , nonmetallic , highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula h2 .
most of the hydrogen on earth is in molecules such as water and organic compounds because hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most non-metallic elements .
hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry with many reactions exchanging protons between soluble molecules .
in ionic compounds , it can take a negative charge an anion known as a hydride and written as h ??? , or as a positively charged species h + .
the latter cation is written as though composed of a bare proton , but in reality , hydrogen cations in ionic compounds always occur as more complex species .
the most common isotope of hydrogen is protium name rarely used , symbol 1h with a single proton and no neutrons .
as the simplest atom known , the hydrogen atom has been of theoretical use .
for example , as the only neutral atom with an analytic solution to the schr ?? dinger equation , the study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics
hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century , via the mixing of metals with acids .
in 1766 ??? 81 , henry cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance , and that it produces water when burned , a property which later gave it its name : in greek ,
industrial production is mainly from the steam reforming of natural gas , and less often from more energy-intensive hydrogen production methods like the electrolysis of water .
most hydrogen is employed near its production site , with the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing e.g. , hydrocracking and ammonia production , mostly for the fertilizer market .
hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals , complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks .
in photography , bracketing is the general technique of taking several shots of the same subject using different camera settings .
bracketing is useful and often recommended in situations that make it difficult to obtain a satisfactory image with a single shot , especially when a small variation in exposure parameters has a comparatively large effect on the resulting image .
autobracketing is automatic bracketing by using a setting on the camera to take several bracketed shots in contrast to the photographer altering the settings by hand between each shot .
given the time it takes to accomplish multiple shots , it is typically , but not always , used for static subjects .
visualization of fragmentation and then of defragmentation
in the maintenance of file systems , defragmentation is a process that reduces the amount of fragmentation .
it does this by physically organizing the contents of the mass storage device used to store files into the smallest number of contiguous regions fragments .
it also attempts to create larger regions of free space using compaction to impede the return of fragmentation .
some defragmentation utilities try to keep smaller files within a single directory together , as they are often accessed in sequence .
defragmentation is advantageous and relevant to file systems on electromechanical disk drives .
the movement of the hard drive 's read\/write heads over different areas of the disk when accessing fragmented files is slower , compared to accessing the entire contents of a non-fragmented file sequentially without moving the read\/write heads to seek
a service-level agreement sla is a part of a service contract where a service is formally defined .
in practice , the term sla is sometimes used to refer to the contracted delivery time of the service or performance .
as an example , internet service providers will commonly include service level agreements within the terms of their contracts with customers to define the level s of service being sold in plain language terms .
in this case the sla will typically have a technical definition in terms of mean time between failures mtbf , mean time to repair or mean time to recovery mttr ; various data rates ; throughput

bernard lawrence `` bernie '' madoff ; born april 29 , 1938 is an american former stockbroker , investment advisor , financier , and white collar criminal .
he is the former non-executive chairman of the nasdaq stock market , and the admitted operator of a ponzi scheme that is considered to be the largest financial fraud in u.s. history .
madoff founded the wall street firm bernard l. madoff investment securities llc in 1960 , and was its chairman until his arrest on december 11 , 2008 .
the firm was one of the top market maker businesses on wall street , which bypassed `` specialist '' firms by directly executing orders over the counter from retail brokers .
he employed at the firm his brother peter as senior managing director and chief compliance officer ; peter has since been sentenced to 10 years in prison .
peter 's daughter shana madoff as the firm 's rules and compliance officer and attorney , and his sons andrew and mark mark committed suicide by hanging exactly two years after his father 's arrest .
on december 10 , 2008 , madoff 's sons told authorities that their father had confessed to them that the asset management unit of his firm was a massive ponzi scheme , and quoted him as describing it as ``
the following day , fbi agents arrested madoff and charged him with one count of securities fraud .
the u.s. securities and exchange commission sec had previously conducted investigations into madoff 's business practices , but did not uncover the massive fraud .
in march 2009 , madoff pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies and admitted to turning his wealth management business into a massive ponzi scheme that defrauded thousands of investors of billions of dollars .
madoff said he began the ponzi scheme in the early 1990s .
however , federal investigators believe the fraud began as early as the 1970s , and those charged with recovering the missing money believe the investment operation may never have been legitimate .
the amount missing from client accounts , including fabricated gains , was almost $ 65 billion .
the court-appointed trustee estimated actual losses to investors of $ 18 billion .
on june 29 , 2009 , he was sentenced to 150 years in prison , the maximum allowed .

many people were involved in the invention of radio as we now know it .
several possible methods of wireless communication were considered , including inductive and capacitive induction and transmission through the ground , however the method used for radio today exclusively involves the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves .
after early speculation on the subject , experimental work on the connection between electricity and magnetism began around 1820 with the work of hans christian ?? rsted and continued with the work of andr ?? - marie amp ?? re
these investigations culminated in the complete theory of electromagnetism developed by james clerk maxwell .
this theory described the theoretical basis of the propagation of electromagnetic waves .
after maxwell 's theory was published many people experimented with wireless communication , some intentionally using maxwell 's theory some not .
it is considered likely that the first intentional transmission of a signal by means of electromagnetic waves was performed by david edward hughes around 1880 , although this was considered to be induction at the time .
the first systematic and unequivocal transmission of em waves was performed by heinrich rudolf hertz and described in papers published in 1887 and 1890 .
hertz famously considered these results as being of little practical value .
after hertz 's work many people were involved in the development of components and theory involved with the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves .
others , notably guglielmo marconi , were concerned with practical improvements and the commercial application of radio to wireless telegraphy .
later on reginald a. fessenden became the first to send an audio signal by means of electromagnetic waves .
scurvy is a disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin c , which is required for the synthesis of collagen in humans .
the chemical name for vitamin c , ascorbic acid , is derived from the latin name of scurvy , scorbutus , which also provides the adjective scorbutic `` of , characterized by or having to do with scurvy ''
scurvy often presents itself initially as symptoms of malaise and lethargy , followed by formation of spots on the skin , spongy gums , and bleeding from the mucous membranes .
spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs , and a person with the ailment looks pale , feels depressed , and is partially immobilized .
as scurvy advances , there can be open , suppurating wounds , loss of teeth , jaundice , fever , neuropathy and death .
scurvy was at one time common among sailors , pirates and others aboard ships at sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored subsisting instead only on cured and salted meats and dried grains and by
it was described by hippocrates c. 460 bc ??? c. 380 bc , and herbal cures for scurvy have been known in many native cultures since prehistory .
scurvy was one of the limiting factors of marine travel , often killing large numbers of the passengers and crew on long-distance voyages .
this became a significant issue in europe from the beginning of the modern era in the age of discovery in the 15th century , continuing to play a significant role through world war i in the 20th century .
while today scurvy is known to be caused by a nutritional deficiency , until the isolation of vitamin c and direct evidence of its link to scurvy in 1932 , numerous theories and treatments were proposed , often on little
this inconsistency is attributed to the lack of vitamin c as a distinct concept , an inability to reliably link different foods notably present in fresh citrus , watercress , and organ meat to scurvy .
an additional concept required to understand scurvy was the degradation of vitamin c by exposure to air and copper and other transition metal salts such as those of iron , thus changing the links of foods to scurvy over time
treatment by fresh food , particularly citrus fruit , was periodically implemented , as it had been since antiquity .
however until the 1930s , treatment was inconsistent , with many ineffective treatments used into the 20th century .
it was a scottish surgeon in the royal navy , james lind who first proved it could be treated with citrus fruit in experiments he described in his 1753 book , a treatise of the scurvy , though his advice
in infants , scurvy is sometimes referred to as barlow 's disease , named after sir thomas barlow , a british physician who described it .
however , barlow 's disease may also refer to mitral valve prolapse .
other eponyms for scurvy include moeller 's disease and cheadle 's disease .
scurvy does not occur in most animals because they can synthesize their own vitamin c.
however , humans and other higher primates the simians - monkeys and apes - and tarsiers , guinea pigs , most or all bats , and some species of birds and fish lack an enzyme l-gulonolactone oxidase
vitamin c is widespread in plant tissues , with particularly high concentrations occurring in citrus fruits oranges , lemons , limes , grapefruits , tomatoes , potatoes , cabbages , and green peppers .

saddle creek records is an american record label based in omaha , nebraska .
started as a college class project on entrepreneurship , the label was founded by mike mogis and justin oberst in 1993 as lumberjack records .
mogis soon turned over his role in the company to robb nansel .
the label is named after saddle creek road , a street that cuts through the east side of midtown omaha , and the beginnings of a scene whose members included conor oberst then a solo artist , currently of
collectively , they were known unofficially as the `` creekers '' .
saddle creek first appeared in print on a show flyer , offering to `` spend an evening with saddle creek '' later to be the title of the label 's dvd .
saddle creek became an incorporated entity as a result of a class project on entrepreneurship .
distribution is handled by the alternative distribution alliance , which is under the warner music group umbrella .
saddle creek records continues to be the flagship label of a style of music called `` the omaha sound '' , characterized by a slight country twang .
this is increasingly inaccurate , though , with the rise of more electronic sounds such as those favored by the faint and broken spindles .
the eclectic sounds of saddle creek 's disparate member bands is somewhat explained by their history ; a number of the original members of the label attended grade school together .
a `` sister label '' , of sorts , to saddle creek is team love , started by conor oberst in 2004 .
the label opened arms to their first bands not based in omaha in 2001 with releases by now it 's overhead and sorry about dresden .
other non-nebraskan artists followed , including los angeles 's rilo kiley , eric bachmann formerly leader of archers of loaf and crooked fingers from north carolina , georgie james washington d.c. , two gallants san

the dvd features extensive interviews with the saddle creek bands , archival footage , and rare live performances .
on june 8 , 2007 , the label opened their own music venue named slowdown after the group slowdown virginia , located in downtown omaha , nebraska .
good friday is a religious holiday observed primarily by christians commemorating the crucifixion of jesus christ and his death at calvary .
the holiday is observed during holy week as part of the paschal triduum on the friday preceding easter sunday , and may coincide with the jewish observance of passover .
it is also known as holy friday , great friday , black friday , or easter friday , though the latter properly refers to the friday in easter week .
based on the details of the canonical gospels , the crucifixion of jesus was most likely to have been on a friday the day before the sabbath .
the estimated year of the crucifixion is ad 33 , by two different groups , and originally as ad 34 by isaac newton via the differences between the biblical and julian calendars and the crescent of the moon .
a third method , using a completely different astronomical approach based on a lunar crucifixion darkness and eclipse model consistent with apostle peter 's reference to a `` moon of blood '' in acts 2:20 , points to

the attack on pearl harbor called hawaii operation or operation ai by the japanese imperial general headquarters operation z in planning and the battle of pearl harbor was a surprise military strike conducted by the imperial
from the standpoint of the defenders , the attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. hawaiian time .
the attack was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the u.s. pacific fleet from interfering with military actions the empire of japan was planning in southeast asia against overseas territories of the united kingdom , the netherlands
the base was attacked by 353 japanese fighters , bombers and torpedo planes in two waves , launched from six aircraft carriers .
all eight u.s. navy battleships were damaged , with four being sunk .
two of these were later raised , and with the remaining four repaired , six battleships returned to service later in the war .
the japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers , three destroyers , an anti-aircraft training ship , and one minelayer .
188 u.s. aircraft were destroyed ; 2,402 americans were killed and 1,282 wounded .
important base installations such as the power station , shipyard , maintenance , and fuel and torpedo storage facilities , as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building also home of the intelligence section were not attacked
japanese losses were light : 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost , and 65 servicemen killed or wounded .
one japanese sailor was captured .
the attack came as a profound shock to the american people and led directly to the american entry into world war ii in both the pacific and european theaters .
the following day december 8 , the united states declared war on japan .
domestic support for non-interventionism , which had been strong , disappeared .
clandestine support of britain for example the neutrality patrol was replaced by active alliance .
subsequent operations by the u.s. prompted germany and italy to declare war on the u.s. on december 11 , which was reciprocated by the u.s. the same day .
there were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by japan .
however , the lack of any formal warning , particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing , led president franklin d. roosevelt to proclaim december 7 , 1941 , '' a date which will live in infamy '' .

the kidneys are organs that serve several essential regulatory roles in most animals , including vertebrates and some invertebrates .
they are essential in the urinary system and also serve homeostatic functions such as the regulation of electrolytes , maintenance of acid ??? base balance , and regulation of blood pressure via maintaining salt and water balance .
they serve the body as a natural filter of the blood , and remove wastes which are diverted to the urinary bladder .
in producing urine , the kidneys excrete wastes such as urea and ammonium , and they are also responsible for the reabsorption of water , glucose , and amino acids .
the kidneys also produce hormones including calcitriol , erythropoietin , and the enzyme renin .
located at the rear of the abdominal cavity in the retroperitoneum , the kidneys receive blood from the paired renal arteries , and drain into the paired renal veins .
each kidney excretes urine into a ureter , itself a paired structure that empties into the urinary bladder .
renal physiology is the study of kidney function , while nephrology is the medical specialty concerned with kidney diseases .
diseases of the kidney are diverse , but individuals with kidney disease frequently display characteristic clinical features .
common clinical conditions involving the kidney include the nephritic and nephrotic syndromes , renal cysts , acute kidney injury , chronic kidney disease , urinary tract infection , nephrolithiasis , and urinary tract obstruction .
various cancers of the kidney exist ; the most common adult renal cancer is renal cell carcinoma .
cancers , cysts , and some other renal conditions can be managed with removal of the kidney , or nephrectomy .
when renal function , measured by glomerular filtration rate , is persistently poor , dialysis and kidney transplantation may be treatment options .
although they are not severely harmful , kidney stones can be painful and a nuisance .
the removal of kidney stones involves ultrasound treatment to break up the stones into smaller pieces , which are then passed through the urinary tract .
one common symptom of kidney stones is a sharp pain in the medial\/lateral segments of the lower back .

the chupacabra or chupacabras , from chupar `` to suck '' and cabra `` goat '' , literally `` goat sucker '' is a legendary cryptid rumored to inhabit parts of the americas .
it is associated more recently with sightings of an allegedly unknown animal in puerto rico where these sightings were first reported , mexico , and the united states , especially in the latter 's latin american communities .
the name comes from the animal 's reported habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock , especially goats .
physical descriptions of the creature vary .
eyewitness sightings have been claimed as early as 1995 in puerto rico , and have since been reported as far north as maine , and as far south as chile , and even being spotted outside the americas in countries
it is supposedly a heavy creature , the size of a small bear , with a row of spines reaching from the neck to the base of the tail .

the alps are one of the great mountain range systems of europe stretching approximately across eight alpine countries from austria and slovenia in the east , switzerland , liechtenstein , germany , france to the west and italy and monaco
the mountains were formed over hundreds of millions of years as the african and eurasian tectonic plates collided .
extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as mont blanc and the matterhorn .
mont blanc spans the french ??? italian border , and at is the highest mountain in the alps .
the alpine region area contains many peaks higher than , known as the '' four-thousanders '' .
the altitude and size of the range affects the climate in europe ; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones .
wildlife such as ibex live in the higher peaks to elevations of , and plants such as edelweiss grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations .
evidence of human habitation in the alps goes back to the paleolithic era .
a mummified man , determined to be 5,000 years old , was discovered on a glacier at the austrian ??? italian border in 1991 .
by the 6th century bc , the celtic la t ?? ne culture was well established .
hannibal may have crossed the alps with a herd of elephants , and the romans had settlements in the region .
in 1800 napoleon crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000 .
the 18th and 19th centuries saw an influx of naturalists , writers , and artists , in particular the romantics , followed by the golden age of alpinism as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks .
in world war ii the third reich invaded the alpine countries , with the exception of switzerland and liechtenstein ; adolf hitler kept a base of operation in the bavarian alps throughout the war .
the alpine region has a strong cultural identity .
the traditional culture of farming , cheesemaking , and woodworking still exists in alpine villages , although the tourist industry began to grow early in the 20th century and expanded greatly after world war ii to become the dominant industry
the winter olympic games have been hosted in the swiss , french , italian , austrian and german alps .
at present the region is home to 14 million people and has 120 million annual visitors .
family transmission of basque language basque as initial language
percentage of students registered in basque language schools 2000 ??? 2005 .
location of the basque-language provinces within spain and france
basque endonym : , is the ancestral language of the basque people , who inhabit the basque country , a region spanning an area in northeastern spain and southwestern france .
it is spoken by 27 % of basques in all territories 714,136 out of 2,648,998 .
of these , 663,035 live in the spanish part of the basque country and the remaining 51,100 live in the french part .
in academic discussions of the distribution of basque in spain and france , it is customary to refer to three ancient provinces in france and four spanish provinces .
native speakers are concentrated in a contiguous area including parts of the spanish autonomous communities of the basque country and navarre and in the western half of the french d ?? partement of pyr ?? n ?? es-atlantiques .
the basque autonomous community is an administrative entity within the binational ethnographic basque country incorporating the traditional spanish provinces of biscay , gipuzkoa , and ?? lava , which retain their existence as politico-administrative divisions .
these provinces and many areas of navarre are heavily populated by ethnic basques , but basque was , at least until the 1990s , not spoken as a native language in most of ?? lava , western parts of biscay
in southwestern france , the ancient basque-populated provinces were labourd , lower navarre , and soule .
they and other regions were consolidated into a single d ?? partement in 1790 under the name basses-pyr ?? n ?? es , a name which persisted until 1970 .
a standardized form of the basque language , called euskara batua , was developed by the basque language academy in the late 1960s .
euskara batua was created so that basque language could be used ??? and easily understood by all basque speakers ??? in formal situations education , mass media , literature , and this is its main use today .
the role of this standard basque language depends on the linguistic educational model of each region and each school .
in most areas of the spanish basque country , the educational model d , where all subjects are taught in basque , except `` spanish language and literature '' which is taught in spanish is now the predominant
in france , the basque language school seaska and the association for a bilingual basque and french schooling ikasbi meet a wide range of basque language educational needs up to the sixth form , while often struggling to
apart from this standardized version , there are five main basque dialects : bizkaian , gipuzkoan , and upper navarrese in spain , and navarrese ??? lapurdian and zuberoan in france .
although they take their names from the mentioned historic provinces , the dialect boundaries are not congruent with province boundaries .
in molecular biology , human chorionic gonadotropin hcg is a hormone produced by the fertilized egg after conception .
later during pregnancy it is made by the developing placenta , and later by the placental component syncytiotrophoblast .
some cancerous tumors produce this hormone ; therefore , elevated levels measured when the patient is not pregnant can lead to a cancer diagnosis .
however , it is not known whether this production is a contributing cause or an effect of tumorigenesis .
the pituitary analog of hcg , known as luteinizing hormone lh , is produced in the pituitary gland of males and females of all ages .
, the fda has prohibited the sale of `` homeopathic '' and over the counter hcg diet products and declared them fraudulent and illegal .

a given name is purposefully given , usually by a child 's parents at or near birth , in contrast to an inherited one such as a family name .
a given name is sometimes legally changed through a name change .
given names are often used in a familiar and friendly manner in informal situations .
in more formal situations the surname is used instead , unless it is necessary to distinguish between people with the same surname .
the idiom `` on a first-name basis '' or `` on first-name terms '' alludes to the familiarity of addressing another by a given name .

economics is the social science that analyzes the production , distribution , and consumption of goods and services .
the term economics comes from the ancient greek ' , `` management of a household , administration '' from ' , `` house '' + ' , `` custom '' or `` law ''
political economy was the earlier name for the subject , but economists in the late 19th century suggested `` economics '' as a shorter term for `` economic science '' that also avoided a narrow political-interest connotation and as similar
a focus of the subject is how economic agents behave or interact and how economies work .
consistent with this , a primary textbook distinction is between microeconomics and macroeconomics .
microeconomics examines the behavior of basic elements in the economy , including individual agents such as households and firms or as buyers and sellers and markets , and their interactions .
macroeconomics analyzes the entire economy and issues affecting it , including unemployment , inflation , economic growth , and monetary and fiscal policy .
other broad distinctions include those between positive economics describing `` what is '' and normative economics advocating `` what ought to be '' ; between economic theory and applied economics ; between rational and behavioral economics
economic analysis may be applied throughout society , as in business , finance , health care , and government , but also to such diverse subjects as crime , education , the family , law , politics , religion ,
at the turn of the 21st century , the expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as economic imperialism .
an increasing number of economists have called for increased emphasis on environmental sustainability ; this area of research is known as ecological economics .
us county household median income 2009 .
median us household income , 2001-2011
household income is a measure commonly used by the united states government and private institutions .
each household is measured by the income of every resident over the age of 15 .
income includes wages and salaries , unemployment insurance , disability payments , child support payments received , regular rental receipts , as well as any personal business , investment , or other kinds of income received routinely .
while inflation-adjusted `` real '' household income had been increasing almost every year from 1945 to 1999 , it has since been flat and even decreased recently .
u.s. median household income fell from $ 51,144 in 2010 to $ 50,502 in 2011 .
extreme poverty in the united states , meaning households living on less than $ 2 per day before government benefits , doubled from 1996 to 1.5 million households in 2011 , including 2.8 million children .
the residents of the household do not have to be related to the head of the household for their earnings to be considered part of the household 's income .
as households tend to share a similar economic context , the use of household income remains among the most widely accepted measures of income .
that the size of a household is not commonly taken into account in such measures may distort any analysis of fluctuations within or among the household income categories , and may render direct comparisons between quintiles difficult or even impossible
