prison gangs have a de facto negotiation system to defuse potential conflicts , black gang members said .
nor does it count many street gangs , whose members may loosely organize behind bars .
`` there was a time when most of the gang members in texas prisons were gang members who had joined in prison .
but now the street gang members who are being incarcerated actually outnumber what we were historically calling prison gang members . ''
crips members , who did not want to be identified , note that even white supremacist groups like the aryan brotherhood generally refrain from collective attacks on blacks .
`` if they respect us , we respect them , '' one crip said .
if members of rival gangs tangle over a personal issue , in theory the isolated combatants are permitted to resolve their differences without gang interference .
the members of the crips agree they would die for their gang , and some would be willing to kill .
prosecutors said the '' rampage of murder and mayhem '' was carried out with bullets that had been painted blue , the crips ' signature color .
two men were convicted monday of abducting and killing two young women and wounding a third woman as part of a gang initiation .
prosecutors said queen , tirado and other members of the crips gang randomly picked the women as part of an initiation ritual in 1998 .
round rock , texas _ fearful that a gang called the bloods would terrorize the town and her students , too , the principal of round rock high school decided one day to ban the color red .
red was the gang 's color , said sherry blackett , the new principal of the town 's largest high school .
red was the color of violence .
red was a color she connected with the town 's first drive -by shooting late last month , the vandalism of a school art project one week later and frequent fights among students .
`` i 'm trying to create an environment that will not allow gangs to flourish , so i banned the color red , '' she said .
the principal , who spent most of her career in corpus christi , texas , added that she knew of kids killed for wearing gang colors .
red 's a good color , '' said andrea miller , a sophomore .
`` for somebody like me to have a color banned from my wardrobe is really kind of silly .
indeed , local police have identified at least six colors associated with gangs , including the color maroon , which is one of the school colors of round rock high .
hampton said the vandalism at the school , the defacing of artwork , did not appear gang -related , in spite of the fact that it was carried out with red spray paint .
`` i would say this is not a case of gang graffiti , '' said sgt .
jack abbott , gang specialist for the round rock police force .
`` that was n't the purpose of the shooting , because of the color red , '' he said .
`` he thinks he ought to be able to wear whatever color he wants and i agree , '' she said .
`` you should n't punish the kids for something that may or may not happen , and banning a color is silly .
are we advertising gang colors by flying our flags outside the school ? ''
what bothers her most , she said , is it appeared to be a selective color ban aimed at minority students .
limp bizkit lead singer fred durst did a lot before he hit the big time .
'' i hope he 's ok , '' said limp bizkit singer fred durst .
limp bizkit singer fred durst says : `` i used to listen to him nonstop back in the day .
`` we 're gon na bring something you 've never witnessed , '' says the hype-minded fred durst of limp bizkit .
new york _ as lead singer of limp bizkit , the band currently at the top of the billboard album charts , fred durst has created a million-dollar persona by acting like the least likely to succeed .
within limp bizkit 's sludgy , hip-hop-stained rock songs , durst expresses emotions that endear him to teenagers : frustration , vulnerability and a sense of moral outrage .
and if someone such as kid rock or limp bizkit vocalist fred durst is commanding platinum record sales and sold-out concerts , is he adding something to hip-hop 's legacy or cashing in on it ?
nor did the cameras show heather locklear standing as far away as possible from her co- presenter , the limp bizkit singer fred durst , after he spontaneously cheered her breasts .
the star of this episode is unquestionably fred durst , front man for limp bizkit , a group that minted rap- metal , the aggressive , hypermacho and extremely lucrative new pop-music genre that mixes rap with rock .
if people just know the limp bizkit name or maybe just heard a tune , that 's cool , says durst .
more music to our ears : the jacksonville band limp bizkit is n't happy being merely a best-selling rap metal group with a hit album .
the group 's dj lethal is now a member of limp bizkit .
just then , on the tape , durst , enraged that the show has just run the wrong version of a limp bizkit video , threatens to hide a tv camera somewhere on the person of a staff member .
`` dude , i want to be massive , '' durst says in the august issue of spin magazine .
born in jacksonville , fla . , durst grew up in gastonia , n.c . , where his love of hip-hop music and break dancing made him an outcast .
they made a demo and sent it to a member of the band korn , who had gotten a tattoo from durst while touring in florida .
eminem 's dramatic entrance came a few hours after a gay rights group protested his violent lyrics outside radio city music hall .
another expat brit living in la , lemmy used to play in the space-rock band hawkwind and formed motorhead when he was kicked out _ as he was from every other group he 'd ever been in .
`` we 're heavy and , sometimes , we 're not heavy , '' durst says .
the ozzfest is a proving ground but not , durst hopes , a competition .
`` our world today is really emotional , '' says durst .
singer-choreographer fred durst wants a multimedia empire _ and some respect .
inside iran : much has changed in iran since a group of americans were held hostage at the u.s . embassy in tehran .
but durst is not the loser he would like people to think he is .
durst 's social conservatism was just like that of a talk-radio host : he played the schlumpy , marginalized everyman who just wants a chance to live without interference from a bunch of weirdos .
this makes for a hybrid that would be more interesting if the band did not constantly mire itself in boring tempos , and if durst had any talent as a singer .
his limited range was clearly exposed when aaron lewis of staind , the night 's opening group , outsang him during the ballad `` no sex. ''
durst 's rapping engages when it gains a flippant tone , but he seems to prefer desolate moaning .
most irritating , though , is durst 's outsider stance , through which the band gains emotional credibility .
but to feel connected with durst , his fans must relate to his estrangement .
more comically , there are the detroit acts eminem -lrb- `` my name is ... '' -rrb-
chuck d , whose seminal rap group public enemy has exerted a strong influence over rock acts since the late 1980s , is n't as impressed .
`` so , there was and is a hip-hop community that is composed of jews , blacks , arabs , latinos _ you name it .
durst , who grew up poor in gastonia , n.c . , tells stories of how his white friends ostracized him in high school because of his affection for rap music .
real name : bob ritchie , 27 .

everlast is the name of an athletic gear manufacturer best known for its boxing trunks .
m.o . : made a name with house of pain , an irish - american hip-hop act influenced by cypress hill .
lead vocalist : fred durst , 28 .
m.o . : one-time tattoo artist and hip-hop fan durst was befriended by california metal act korn , which helped the group get signed and put it on its `` family values '' tour .
the new release , the group 's second , is sharply produced with radio-friendly fare to help the band expand from its hard-core audience built up through constant touring .
what 's unusual : durst is a devout lutheran .
his group worked through the refreshing subtleties of `` the fragile , '' the title track of the band 's new album .
wit shone in the cutting repartee of rock , who spared no one except a few reigning legends like the artist and madonna , and the performance of the mysterious torrance community dance group .
the group bumbled its way through a live routine that poked sweet fun at the cliches of awards-ceremony choreography , making sure this event came equipped with its own parody .
it was durst who put his finger on the scale .
fred durst appeared in `` backstage sluts 2 . '' porn gives bands cool points and boosts their fan base .
and at that point , rage is no longer the problem of a group of problem kids .
these days , fred durst , the man who has taken lumps for `` triggering '' woodstock , hedges his bets , sounding simultaneously apologetic and defiant .
`` i literally do n't do anything to hurt anyone , '' durst says .
`` all of a sudden i was obsessed with this beat and this way of storytelling , '' durst explains .
in a place like gastonia , and then jacksonville , fla . , where his family moved , durst was called `` nigger lover . ''
in the years after school , durst fathered a child , spent a year in the navy , worked as a tattoo artist and then formed a band .
durst sits on a couch , repairing a skateboard as the rest of the group sets up .
durst has become a senior vice president at interscope records ; as a high-ranking talent scout , he envisions huge battles-of-the-bands traveling across the country , with the best getting signed to his label .
and durst says he has raised `` hundreds of thousands of dollars '' for a cable channel featuring round-the-clock extreme sports and music programming .
the responsibility weighs heavily on durst 's sloping shoulders .
another subplot features limp bizkit 's singer-rapper , fred durst , who also is a senior vice president of interscope records , whose parent label , universal music , joined the riaa in a separate lawsuit against napster .
durst has become a senior vice president at interscope records ; as a high-ranking talent scout , he envisions huge battles-of-the-bands traveling across the country , with the best getting signed to his label .
the target is napster , the software company that allows computer users to swap music files with other users for free , whether the music is by unknown bands or superstars .
but the riaa is concerned with signed artists who record for labels that do not want to give away their music for free. ''
you 're messing with the record companies now and they do n't want to lose that money , '' adds j.c . chasez of the band 'n sync .
the record labels have remained quiet and are letting the riaa fight its battles , though more and more artists are speaking out .
once i record something , it 's not public domain to give it away freely .
napster was founded last year by shawn fanning , a 19-year-old then- northeastern university student who dropped out after his freshman year to move to san mateo , calif . , where the company is based .
the firm refers to itself as the `` embattled mp3 file-swapping software company . ''
many observers say that the major record labels have been slow in climbing aboard the digital revolution , hence the fill-the-breach mentality of services like napster and my.mp3 . com .
meanwhile , a new company , myplay . com , has been working with labels on a `` totally legal basis , '' says founder david pakman , who worked with apple computer and is also a rock drummer .
his company enables users to have a digital locker of songs , but royalties are paid on them and other listeners can listen to them for two weeks but ca n't copy them .
i believe it 's hurting record sales , but it 's also doing what it 's supposed to do _ building new fans . ''

the comet was named after its two observers -- two amateur astronomers in the united states who discovered it on july 22 , 1995 .
the comet was first spotted by hale and bopp , both us astronomers , on july 22 , 1995 .
the comet , one of the brightest comets this century , was first spotted by hale and bopp , both astronomers in the united states , on july 23 , 1995 .
nanjing , january 5 -lrb- xinhua -rrb- -- the comet hale-bopp , whose cycle of return is 3,000 years , will reach its perigee on april 1 , 1997 , a chinese scientist said .
when it returns next year its luminosity might surpass that of haley 's comet when it returned in 1986 , according to astronomers .
shanghai , march 11 -lrb- xinhua -rrb- -- hale-bopp , a newly-discovered extraordinarily large comet in the solar system , has been recently observed for the first time in china .
astronomers at the shanghai observatory under the chinese academy of sciences located the comet , which has a very dim light , 700 million km from the earth .
drawing closer to the sun at a speed of 1.3 million km per day , the comet is expected to reach the proximity of the sun around the end of march or in early april 1997 .
it was later designated as a new comet by the international astronomical union .
it is reported that the comet is 100-150 km in diameter , five to 10 times the size of the world-famed halley 's comet .
major observatories in china are preparing for a co-observation on the comet .
nanjing , april 9 -lrb- xinhua -rrb- -- the hale-bopp comet is set to become one of the brightest comets of the 20th century , chinese astronomers have predicted .
hale-bopp was 1.07 billion km away from the sun in last july when it was discovered by two amateur astronomers in the united states .
at that time , the hale-bopp was 250 times brighter than the haley 's comet if the latter were put in the same distance .
the yunnan observatory and the shanghai observatory had shot pictures of hale-bopp comet in february this year .
the comet 's nucleus is 40 km in diameter , and its 'hair ' indicates intensive activities inside .
in august , september and october last year , french astronomers discovered three dust explosions around the comet , each explosion lasted for two days , and the comet was three stellar magnitudes brighter compared to before .
by that time , people will be able to see the comet with their naked eyes .
observation of the comet is of great significance for scientific research , chen daohan said .
nanjing , december 17 -lrb- xinhua -rrb- -- chinese scientists in east china 's jiangsu province have shot pictures of hale-bopp , the newly-discovered comet .
astronomers at the purple mountain observatory under the chinese academy of sciences recently succeeded in photographing the comet by using a refracting telescope together with a ccd detector .
the comet has since attracted great attention from astronomers around the world .
since early this month the comet has appeared in the western part of the sky after sunset , making it difficult for scientists to conduct observatory work .
astronomers say the best opportunity for observation will start from early february to the middle of march 1997 when the comet can be seen in the eastern sky .
latest observations and calculations show that the hale-bopp has a cycle of 4,200 years , and it will reach its perigee on march 23 next year when it reaches a distance of 190 million km from the earth .
the total eclipse coincides with the arrival of the hale bopp comet , which occurs once every 3,000 years .
the simultaneous arrival of the hale-bopp comet , which only approaches the earth once every 3,000 years , lent the eclipse a rare status that was shared by nearly 90,000 onlookers .
chinese experts said the hale-bopp only approaches the earth about every 2,500 years .
the orbit of hale-bopp is almost vertical to that of the earth , so that scientists will be able to catch some primitive information on the verges of the solar system .
he said that between march 25 to april 10 , the comet moves to the nearest point from the earth and the brightness of the comet will reach its maximum level .
in 1955 , actor james dean was killed in a two - car collision near cholame , calif .
in fact , when star james dean was killed in the auto crash on may 5 , 1955 , he was on his way to visit his new friend , monty roberts .
on sept . 30 , 1955 , dean was on his way to a california auto rally and to look at a farm with monty when he was killed in a traffic accident .
hollywood , july 19 _ the death of james dean in a car crash in 1955 turned that brooding 24-year-old movie star into a tragic legend and symbol of alienation and hurt among teen-agers in the 1950s and 1960s .
in 1955 , the studio asked him to become a technical adviser on elia kazan 's `` east of eden , '' starring james dean .
a south korean court on wednesday rebuffed an attempt by a relative of james dean to collect damages from a local company that produces a line of underwear bearing the late actor 's name .
winslow accused j . enterprise ltd . and its owner , joo byoung-jin , of violating trademark laws by producing `` james dean '' underwear and opening more than 100 stores to market them .
on wednesday , judge kim duk -jin of the seoul appellate court said that the plaintiff lacked evidence that he represented dean 's estate .
joo said he had registered james dean 's name as a legitimate trademark with the korean industrial property office , and refused to pay royalties for using the name .
winslow had demanded that all of joo 's james dean trademarks be invalidated .
j . enterprise began selling women 's and men 's james dean underwear in 1990 .
in 1962 , black student james meredith succeeded on his fourth try to register for classes at the university of mississippi .
but he did more than speak .
he did what he does best _ he did n't whisper , he listened .
roberts and dean became friendly , and the young actor asked roberts to look for a horse farm he might buy .
those who did n't cooperate were ostracized .
i could tell she did n't want to go , but a deal was a deal .
where did the children learn about such violence ?
a sure way to become a legend is to die young .
montgomery clift was n't ; but if the auto accident that almost killed him at age 34 had done so , he would today be a legend equal to or even surpassing dean .
bette davis was the pre-eminent female star during the long heyday of the studios and would be a less sullied legend today if she had simply quit on top , as garbo and shearer did .
`` but at the same time he has never been tested by a war , he did n't grow up hunting or fishing or farming .
elvis presley -lrb- 1935-1977 -rrb- , james dean -lrb- 1931-1955 -rrb- and marlon brando -lrb- 1924- -rrb- are the new men : young , surly , cocksure .
for years filmmakers have toyed with projects about james dean but were locked in a catch- 22 : studios would only finance the movie with a star , or at least a name actor .
the playwright israel horovitz , who had worked on a james dean screenplay for years , recalled that the actor ethan hawke had told him : `` if you do a james dean imitation , they 'll kill you .
if you do n't do a james dean imitation , they 'll kill you .
the film , `` james dean : an invented life , '' is now in production in los angeles .
to play dean , rydell and bill gerber , the movie 's executive producer , selected james franco , a little-known , 22-year-old television actor from palo alto , calif .
rydell said he had cast franco almost as soon as he saw the actor , who bears a resemblance to dean , and spoke to him at length .
franco , who has appeared in some television films and independent features as well as the nbc series `` freaks and geeks , '' said that during his teen-age years he was often told that he looked like dean .
`` i do n't have blond hair and blue eyes , like he did , '' said franco .
`` i took up smoking , like dean , and cut off most of my friends , '' he said .
dean 's life was tormented .
horovitz said the screenplay was , largely , a story about dean 's hunt for a father who abandoned him when he was 8 his mother died .
years later dean turned to directors like elia kazan , george stevens and nicholas ray and even executives like jack warner as father figures .
just before his death dean signed what was then an unprecedented $ 1-million deal with warner for nine films .
certainly dean 's personality and the characters he played on screen seemed to foreshadow some of the mood of the 1960s and '70s .
referring to `` rebel without a cause , '' he declared , `` the film _ and dean _ demonstrated that adolescents are loaded with anxiety and torture and rage. ''
the dean screenplay had been circulating at warner brothers for nearly a decade under the aegis of marvin worth , producer of `` lenny '' -lrb- 1974 -rrb- and `` the rose '' -lrb- 1979 -rrb- .
rydell said he was friendly with dean in the '50s when they were struggling theater and television actors .
and suddenly jimmy leapt into the street , whipped his jacket off and did a bullfighter 's pass .

members of the american association of retired persons -lrb- aarp -rrb- qualify for discounts at many hotels and attractions .
aarp officials , distraught and discouraged at being shunned by the boomers , a few months ago changed its name from american association of retired persons to just aarp .
renaissance 's alliances with companies such as american express , aarp -lrb- american association of retired persons -rrb- and america on line may speed that process .
the survey was conducted among americans 45 and older for aarp , formerly the american association of retired persons .
those groups siding with the troxels are the american association of retired persons -lrb- aarp -rrb- , the national conference of state legislatures , national league of cities and u.s . conference of mayors .
horace b . deets , executive director of the aarp , formerly know as the american association of retired persons , said older employees have the skills , expertise and enthusiasm employers value .
to quote : `` in many respects , we stand in direct opposition to the points of view espoused by the american association of retired persons .
despite the name , retirement is n't a criteria : chances are you will -lrb- or did -rrb- receive overtures from aarp around age 50 ; or call 800-424-3410 .
it read : `` dear friend , forget everything you 've heard about aarp being just for retired people .
but to him and three out of four other baby boomers who have turned 50 since jan . 1 , 1996 , aarp might as well mean rip .
though almost half of all americans over 50 belong to aarp , only one-quarter of eligible baby boomers do , 50 being the age of eligibility .
`` i 've listened to people say that aarp is rocking chairs and old retired people , '' said carola wilson of aarp .
but changing its name to aarp instead of something that embraces boomers and still appeals to existing members might go down as one of the biggest marketing bungles ever , some experts say .
`` their solution to the problem made it worse , '' says marketing expert james r . rosenfield , a member of aarp .
besides , he continued , `` aarp is the world 's worst acronym _ it sounds like a dog barking , like aarp , aarp ! ''
for aarp , there 's a lot at stake .
one , the national association of baby boomers , or nabb , touts itself as the antithesis of aarp .
but wilson of aarp insists its organization is relevant to boomers and many others over 50 .
for instance , one aarp mailing reads : `` experience tells us this may not be the most welcome piece of mail you ever received .
rivkin says aarp chose the same dubious route that kentucky fried chicken did when it rechristened itself kfc to get away from the fear-of-fat word , fried .
`` but in our language all of us grow up understanding that initials stand for something , so we begin translating backwards. ''
and while tom otwell of aarp insists people refer to the organization by its individual initials , rivkin doubts that assertion .
a . r . p . has four syllables , aarp one , '' rivkin said .
meanwhile , scott aylward , president of advertising agency barkley evergreen & partners in kansas city , is n't surprised by boomers ' aversion to aarp .
aarp officials declared that it shattered many of the stereotypes of aging and sexuality .
aarp officials released their poll today with a clear appeal to the aging baby boomers , unveiling the latest issue of modern maturity , which features a photograph of 52-year-old susan sarandon under this headline : `` great sex .
an aarp survey released last week found about one in nine grandparents over the age of 50 helps care for at least one grandchild .
founded in 1956 as an offshoot of the national retired teachers association , aarp is the largest dues-paying organization in the country , with about 32 million members age 50 and up .
aarp was founded in 1958 when a retiree named ethel percy andrus discovered that insurance companies discriminated against older people , including friends from her own california retired teachers association .
and it 's also one obviously meant to counter the common charge that aarp is the `` selfish seniors '' organization .
`` it 's a hard organization to run , because we 're not focused on just one thing _ we 're not like the national rifle association . ''
the american association of retired persons recently became nothing more than its acronym as the organization realized that almost half of its membership was not retired and a good percentage was n't american .
the struggle to the top of the hill for the organization is storied , somewhat sordid history .
seniors are still drawn to insurance packages and discounts on cruises and hotels but the organization acknowledges such `` member services '' are no longer enough .
`` there is a misconception that this is a seniors organization , '' said attendee theresa contino .
the organization not only wants to be younger , but also more diverse .
he will also make many trips to washington for meetings at aarp national headquarters and will represent the association at congressional hearings .
both the massachusetts office and the 10 -state northeastern regional headquarters are in boston .
aarp executive director horace deets called the bill `` good labor , social and economic policy .
`` if we are over the hill , we certainly have picked up steam going downhill , '' said horace deets , the former catholic priest -turned-executive director of the 34 million -member aarp .
a 23 -city , 20 -state bus trip featuring aarp president tess canja and other volunteers that will start in philadelphia during the republican national convention and end two weeks later in los angeles during the democratic national convention .
`` seniors vote in greater proportion that any other age group , and we vote on issues , not on personalities , '' said horace deets , aarp 's executive director .
aarp _ washington _ horace deets , president and co- ceo of the aarp , addresses a national press club luncheon on the senior advocacy group 's legislative priorities and plans for the future .
being the top officer of aarp involves much more than his old job , perkins acknowledges .

`` we are extremely pleased and excited that with beth 's selection , uga has produced rhodes scholars three out of the last four years , '' said uga president michael adams .
he joined time magazine after his years as a rhodes scholar and never worked anywhere else until he entered the government .
a british colonialist in the late 19th century , rhodes ran a mining conglomerate that for decades controlled much of southern africa .
`` he was talking about taking a rhodes scholarship from a racist diamond miner . ''

the black panther party for self-defense was founded in 1966 in oakland by seale and huey newton .
his campaign is being managed by black panther co-founder bobby seale and was inspired by the comeback of another '70s icon , governor -turned- mayor jerry brown .
the black panther party was founded in 1966 by seale and huey newton , who met as students at oakland 's merritt junior college and were working at a city anti-poverty center .
soon afterward he became honorary prime minister of the black panthers , the ultramilitant urban organization begun by huey newton and bobby seale .
and so wednesday , when he announced his bid for an oakland city council seat , hilliard introduced bobby seale , who co-founded the black panther party here , as his campaign manager .
seale ran for mayor of oakland as a black panther in 1973 , losing to a white incumbent in a runoff that brought out more black voters than any other election in the city 's history .
1966 : the black panther party for self-defense is founded in oakland , calif . , by huey p . newton and bobby seale , with the original purpose of protecting residents from police brutality .
1969 : black panther party co-founder bobby seale is ordered bound and gagged by the judge in the chicago `` conspiracy trial '' after protests by seale that he was being denied his constitutional right to counsel .
brown-abram is the daughter of elaine brown , who took over the black panthers in 1974 , when its founder , huey newton , went into exile in cuba .
seale , joining hilliard at the microphone for the bus tour , remembers hatching the party 's founding manifesto , the ten point program , late one night .
but hilliard has at least one political veteran on his side with seale , who ran for oakland mayor in 1973 and has worked for former panther bobby rush , a congressman running for chicago mayor this year .
that , seale told reporters , was not about murder and drugs , but `` was always all about power to all the people , whether they 're black , white , yellow or polka-dot. ''
as a young man , david hilliard plunged into the raw , radical politics of the black panthers .
oakland , a city of 396,000 with jerry brown as mayor , is 43 percent black , 28 percent white , 14 percent hispanic and 14 percent asian .
hilliard , 56 , said his campaign may be based on black panther ideals but is n't limited to blacks .
he now works with the foundation and teaches the history of the black panthers at the new college in san francisco .
hilliard said he wo n't be endorsing all the black panther credo , including the practice of carrying firearms , which he said was particular to the civil unrest of the past .
when america grew up , so did the panthers . ''
thirty years ago , david hilliard walked the streets of west oakland with a black leather jacket on his back and an m-1 carbine in his hands .
these days , the former black panther chief of staff makes the trip as a candidate for city council -- no gun in his grip , less hair on his head , but the same rallying cry :
but hilliard says the old black panther goals of better housing and schools are still relevant .
stop no . 12 on the black panther legacy tour is the street corner where bobby hutton was fatally shot by police in april 1968 after a protracted gun battle .
stop no . 11 is the church where the black panthers began serving free breakfasts to poor children .
raising his voice above the engine 's rumble , hilliard says both sites are key to understanding `` probably the most misunderstood organization in the history of the civil rights movement .
`` i was not only the chairman of the black panther party -- i was the cook of the black panther party , '' he says .
he confesses with a grin that the panthers , who paid the rent by selling mao tse-tung 's little red book at a sizable mark-up , sold thousands of copies `` before we actually read the book. ''
but bloodier confrontations took the lives of police and panthers .
but she later worked with panthers on `` very moderate kinds of coalition politics. ''
`` when america grew up , so did the panthers , '' he says .
the black panther party collapsed in the late 1970s , brought down by deaths , defections and infighting .
he was 57 and is best remembered for his use of the phrase `` black power , '' which in 1967 ignited a white backlash and alarmed an older generation of civil rights leaders , including the rev .
the panther was later adopted by the black panther party .
he once recalled watching from his hotel room in a little alabama town while nonviolent black demonstrators were beaten and shocked with cattle prods by the police .
barely a month after his selection , carmichael , then just 25 , raised the call for black power , thereby signaling a crossroads in the civil rights struggle .
increasingly uncomfortable with king 's resolute nonviolence , he sensed a shift among some younger blacks in the direction of black separatism .
`` what we are going to start saying now is ` black power ! '' '
`` black power ! ''
but if carmichael 's call for `` black power '' galvanized many disenfranchised young blacks , it troubled others , who thought it sounded anti-white , provocative and violent .
after the integrationist , nonviolent speeches and sermons of king and others , few americans , white or black , were prepared for the uncompromising demands of black militants who rallied to carmichael 's cry .
many black leaders of the civil rights movement , though eager to avoid a split in the movement , were clearly upset by the use of the phrase and the separatism it seemed to connote .
in the book `` black power , '' which carmichael wrote in 1967 with charles hamilton , now a professor of political science at columbia university , the authors tried to explain the term .
`` it is a call for black people in this country to unite , '' they wrote , `` to recognize their heritage , to build a sense of community .
it is a call for black people to define their own goals , to lead their own organizations . ''
`` when you talk of black power , you talk of building a movement that will smash everything western civilization has created , '' he told black audiences .
instead of young people singing `` we shall overcome , '' new images of militant black men and women were being shown on television _ black berets , raised fists , men with guns .
and along with goals of social justice and integration came ideas of black separatism and power harking back to the black nationalism that had been preached in the 1920s by marcus garvey .
he moved to guinea , in west africa , in 1969 , saying , `` america does not belong to the blacks , '' and calling on all black americans to follow his example .
he maintained that continued progress for black americans could be made only through `` mass political organization on a pan - african scale. ''
`` black power , '' he said , `` can only be realized when there exists a unified socialist africa . ''
there were times , david hilliard concedes , when the black panther party carried a stigma , conjuring images of violence rather than community empowerment , of black separatism rather than multiculturalism .
the campaign was inspired by the new mayor , edmund g . brown jr . , and his progressive politics , hilliard said , and represents fulfilling the unfinished agenda of the black panther party .
`` we now have a progressive mayor who sounds more like a black panther with every speech he makes .
four years later , the group was credited with helping to elect the city 's first black mayor , lionel wilson .
several former black panthers have also run for office _ and won .
building a community _ that was always the black panthers ' concern. ''
the legacy of the black panther party includes starting a free breakfast program , health clinics and bus service for the elderly .
about 2,000 panthers were arrested around the country during a five-year period beginning in 1967 .
some 20 panthers were killed in shootouts with one another , other revolutionaries , the police or the fbi .
hilliard himself spent several years in prison in the 1970s on charges stemming from a shootout between panthers and the police .
the black panthers had a self-defense posture .
hilliard has spent a great deal of energy preserving the more noble aspects of the panthers ' legacy .
he regularly gives talks about the panthers in the local schools .
in the spring , he said , he will begin teaching a course on the history of the panthers at a local college .
`` the black panthers ' ideals have just as much relevance today as ever , '' hilliard said .

these children of the struggle _ the offspring of black militants , nonviolent activists and even segregationist leaders _ are now adults .

black and white music fans are driving around flipping back and forth between the local rock and rap radio stations , simply looking for the best song .
in 1999 , not only is the most important and popular white music being made derived from rap , but hip-hop is easily the most important genre in america .
so , understandably , there is a lot of hand-wringing going on in the rap community , because the music 's mission to spread across the land has succeeded all too well .
because there is rap music that speaks to all these people .

sony music entertainment plans to make more than 4,000 albums from its catalogs available on demand by storing them on computers and sending them directly to stores via a high-speed computer network .
customers would be able to receive the music in a variety of formats , including cd , dvd , and minidisc , or have it installed directly onto a digital music player .
artwork and liner notes for the music printed out on a laser printer will also be available for purchase .
while the fast and easy digital access may be music to the ears of consumers , some industry analysts cautioned that sony must overcome a few obstacles .
forrester research analyst mark hardie said the diminished laser printer quality of photos and art that accompany the music may work against an increasingly visual consumer .

for followers of music history , these new acts follow a familiar pattern of white artists succeeding with a style invented in black communities .
it dominates popular music .
it is a birthright , something white kids grow up listening to , a standard by which they calibrate their lifetime notion of pop music .
white kids are also intrinsically attracted to hip-hop because it is the only popular music genre that their rockist baby-boomer parents just do n't get .
but the more street and coded hip-hop becomes -lrb- as in the music of juvenile , dmx , jt money or trick daddy -rrb- , the more attractive it is to a middle-class white audience .
in the meantime , scores of white bands are incorporating hip-hop djs while just as many are rapping , but most without paying more than lip service to the culture the music came from .

last year , the prize went to stanley b . prusiner of the university of california at san francisco for his discovery of prions , the rogue proteins identified as causing mad cow disease and other ailments .
the disease , sporadic fatal insomnia , is caused by the same type of deformed proteins , known as prions , that cause mad cow disease and its human variant , creutzfeldt -jakob disease , according to two studies .
prions are proteins with jekyll-and-hyde personalities that cluster in the brain .
the test , developed by private and government researchers , detects the presence of abnormal proteins called prions that cause a group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , or tse .
they would do this by using chimeraplasty to knock out the gene that makes proteins called prions in the sheep .
unlike disease-causing viruses or bacteria , prions are normal proteins found throughout the body tissues of humans and other animals .
folded the wrong way , prions induce other proteins to mimic them .
dr . stephen dearmond , a pathologist at the university of california school of medicine at san francisco , explained that the normal prion protein was folded in a loopy pattern resembling corkscrews .
generally , they are researchers who have made discoveries that sound small on paper but carry large consequences .
when their molecules are folded into the correct shape , prions are benign , though no one knows their function .
the misfolded prions then accumulate in parts of the brain , causing the tissue to break down and become full of holes , like a sponge .
prions are still controversial .
however , the new studies add to evidence the infection is caused by the abnormal shape of the prions , not another agent , drs .
the method is called `` chimeraplasty '' or `` precise genetic surgery '' and relies on high-quality molecules called `` chimeraplasts '' that are made by boston biosystems of bedford .
prions can mutate to cause and transmit mad-cow disease and its variants in other animals .
but for reasons that are not at all understood , normal prions sometimes transform themselves into tiny particles that can not be killed with boiling water , chemical disinfectants or strong radiation .
these prions , almost impossible to destroy , accumulate in the brains of infected animals and people , destroying cells and leaving spongy holes in the tissue .
but a new variant of cjd now is killing young britons who acquired the disease from eating cattle infected with abnormal prions of their own .
unlike the misfolded prions in sporadic cjd , which are found exclusively in brain tissue , new variant prions are found in the brain , tonsils , appendix , spleen and lymph nodes .
pathologists are examining 18,000 specimens from tonsil removed in the last two decades ; 3,000 tonsils have been tested but the results have not been made public , will said .
results of experiments , to be published soon , show that the misfolded deer prion can , in a test tube , convert normal human , sheep and cattle prions into deadly prions .
many said that local pathologists , fearing prions , would not carry out brain biopsies and that some morticians had refused to embalm the bodies of cjd victims .
prusiner won a nobel prize last year for discovering prions .
last year , the prize went to stanley b . prusiner of the university of california at san francisco for his discovery of prions , the rogue proteins identified as causing mad cow disease .
1997 : stanley b . prusiner , united states , discovery of prions , an infectious agent at the heart of several forms of brain-wasting disease .
last year , the prize went to stanley b . prusiner of the university of california at san francisco for his discovery of prions , the rogue proteins identified as causing mad cow disease and other ailments .
right now , the test for finding the proteins , or prions , requires too much labor for large-scale use on cattle , said researcher dr . fred cohen .
it gives an answer in eight hours , vs . the months needed for the standard means of detecting low levels of prions in tissue , cohen said .
the test involves treating a tissue sample with substances that unfold the prions .
that exposes a section that proteins called antibodies can grab onto , allowing the prions to be detected .
they discovered how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule for the body 's blood vessels , a breakthrough with applications ranging from hardening of the arteries to impotence .
the researchers discovered that nitric oxide tells blood vessels to relax and widen , an effect that helps control blood pressure .
at first , scientists did n't think nitric oxide had so many effects , he said , but `` a lot of researchers have now discovered that nitric oxide does so many things and is so important. ''
the prize citation said murad , while at the university of virginia in 1977 , discovered that nitroglycerin and other vessel -dilating compounds release nitric oxide .
researchers , writing in the october issue of the journal nature medicine , describe a relatively simple way to detect prions .
prions are the mutated proteins responsible for the outbreak of the disease in the united kingdom that led to panic and a ban on exports of british beef .
prions also are believed to cause a human illness , cruetzfeldt -jakob disease , in which holes like those in sponges appear in the brain , leading to dementia and death .
prions can be infectious , but scientists believe they also can arise spontaneously and from genetic mutations .
the scientists also say they have further proof that there are at least eight different strains of prions , all with the same chemical structure but slightly different folding patterns .
it was magnified by the 1994 suicide of kurt cobain , the lead singer for the group nirvana who had struggled with heroin addiction before he shot himself .
but the scene was fading by 1994 , after nirvana front man kurt cobain killed himself and other bands were stymied by drug problems , were breaking up or were backing away from the limelight .
grohl , who was the drummer of grunge band nirvana before the lead singer of that band , kurt cobain , committed suicide , was sentenced monday .
the 1990s version is the saga of nirvana singer kurt cobain , whose wrenching howl and knack for fusing beatlesque melody with a barrage of feedback was a catharsis for his own troubled youth .

kurt cobain , the lead singer of nirvana who committed suicide in 1994 , was said to have listened to `` philosophy of the world '' as a ritual every morning .
seattle _ five years after his death , kurt cobain is being hailed as the most important rock musician of the '90s .
grunge dominated rock after 1991 , led by such multiplatinum releases as nirvana 's `` nevermind `` and soundgarden 's `` badmotorfinger . ''
dave grohl , lead singer of the american rock band the foo fighters , lost his driving privileges in australia for three months for riding a moped while drunk .
that 's almost all that 's heard of cobain 's music since love would n't allow any nirvana music in the film .
credited with reviving rock at a time when it had become tame and predictable , nirvana 's lead singer and guitarist galvanized a generation of listeners with his raw , abrasive songs and soul-searing lyrics .
`` nevermind , '' nirvana 's breakthrough 1991 album , last month reached an important milestone , climbing to 10 million in certified u.s . sales .

grohl played drums in a group that opened up for the peppers nearly a decade ago , as both alternative rock and grohl 's former band _ nirvana _ were poised to revolutionize mainstream rock music .
`` i learned to play more like charlie watts , straight-ahead , 4/4 rock stuff. ''
then he produced the album that changed the direction of rock music in the '90s , nirvana 's `` nevermind . ''
this is one of the promises of muzak , the ubiquitous music heard in crate & barrel and citibank , in malls and mcdonald 's .
here it calms and there it soothes , not to mention the muzak company 's sales pitch : that properly chosen background music can boost sales and increase productivity .
something of a protogeek , general squier experimented with ways to deliver music directly into homes via electrical lines .
to counter that , stimulating music _ chosen for its variations in tempo and instrumentation _ is piped in through office intercoms .
`` background music used to play a covert role in a particular environment , '' he said .
`` now businesses recognize that they can put the power of music to work to create emotional connections .
the elements of foreground music , which makes up the vast majority of muzak 's catalog , are pop songs in their original form .
instrumental background music , also known as environmental music , is what people most associate with the company , though it 's only a small portion of muzak 's services .
after a song is commissioned in its original form or transformed into environmental music , it is evaluated by an audio architect .
the architect rates the song in 45 detailed categories : the mood of the music ; its instrumentation ; its color -lrb- dark or light -rrb- , and whether it is by a male or female vocalist .
aside from smaller background music companies in local markets , muzak dominates the industry .
while some businesses choose to use for background music something like , say , an easy listening station , muzak says that the frequent commercial breaks are a downside to such practices .
according to muzak 's lauren hower , the problem for the company is when offices or retail stores prefer to work without any music at all .
elevator music , he said , `` is just an urban myth. ''
`` my mom was a music teacher and had been making me play piano since i was like 5 years old .
i want to learn how to play drums . '
`` i never learned to play like keith moon , '' he added , laughing .
with garbage , which will perform a sold-out show saturday at the aerial theater in houston , vig is learning yet another way to play the drums .
`` i play acoustic drums , but it triggers samples that we used on the records .
`` but we love using technology to bring all these different elements into the music .
`` when we 'd do a remix , we 'd erase all the tracks except the vocals and record new music , '' he said .
grohl is equal parts facetious and sincere _ devoted to music while at the same time harboring a healthy cynicism about the music industry machinery , and a healthy sense of humor about himself .
`` it seems like they 're about music , not about image or roaring , crazy , dangerous youth dynamics .
but if we were to get out in front of korn 's audience and play something that sounded like the eagles , we 'd get our -lrb- butts -rrb- kicked. ''

rohm and haas , with $ 4 billion in annual sales , makes chemicals found in such products as decorative and industrial paints , semiconductors and shampoos .
for years _ maybe decades _ the chemical industry has argued that its products are safe , and environmentalists have hollered back , `` prove it. ''
on wednesday the chemical manufacturers association will announce that the industry is spending more than $ 1 billion to do just that .
philadelphia -based rohm and hass will also assume $ 268 million of morton 's debt as part of the latest deal .

what fans will want to know , now that the hype can be replaced with actuality , is whether `` the phantom menace '' is sufficiently of a piece with the first three films to make it worth seeing .
`` the phantom menace '' mutes mcewan 's obi-wan and neeson 's qui-gon to the point where we grow detached enough to speculate on possible influences on aspects the new film .
best spoke all of jar jar 's lines , invented his reptilian noises and physically acted out the scenes , but he was ultimately replaced with a computer image .
a peek at a teaser trailer on the film 's web site -lrb- www . finalfantasy . com -rrb-
but weingartner points out that even jar jar was n't completely digital .
with jar jar , there was an actor who did the voice. ''
-lrb- robert philpot is film critic for the fort worth star-telegram .
the voice of jar jar is provided by actor ahmed best , who is black .
ahmed best , the man behind the mask of the new `` star wars '' character jar jar binks , feels like he came to the scene-stealing role from a galaxy far , far away .
worst supporting actors were denise richards of ' 'the world is not enough '' and jar-jar binks -lrb- voice by ahmed best -rrb- of the '' star wars '' prequel .
ahmed best had the challenge of playing a computer-generated character called jar jar binks , a fresh entry to lucas ' universe .
jar jar binks -lrb- voice of ahmed best -rrb- : a gungan , -lrb- a species of amphibians on naboo -rrb- , he 's the cutest of the new computer-generated creatures .
ahmed best -lrb- jar jar binks -rrb- : `` i 'm going to be in the ziegfeld -lrb- theatre in new york -rrb- at one time or another to see this movie .
the amphibious alien jar jar binks owes his existence to a radical digital mutation of actor ahmed best 's performance .
a computer-animated goofball in `` the phantom menace , `` jar jar binks -lrb- voiced by ahmed best -rrb- has inspired the most ire this year .
this year , however , actor robert conrad planned to be on hand .
darth vader -lrb- voice of james earl jones -rrb- : a very bad little doggy : anakin skywalker , all grown up , half -human and half -machine , horribly scarred , and evil as a cornered snake .
there 's no hint of the future in him , though the audience knows this is one high-pitched voice that 's really going to change .
ewan mcgregor , a naturally dashing actor , is stymied by the flat and passive character of young obi-wan kenobi , though his echoes of alec guinness are uncanny at times .
union officials want to be sure filmmakers do n't digitally reproduce an actor 's face without payment , according to rafe greenlee of the screen actors guild in los angeles .
`` now , take the actor away and give the actor no one to act with , -lrb- and -rrb- you do not have the possibility of the strongest performance. ''
jar jar binks : a computer-generated character voiced by ahmed best , he 's an amusing , big-eared member of the gungans , an amphibious , froglike species of the planet naboo .
an alien of the amphibious gungan race , jar jar is clumsy , hyperactive , floppy-eared and 7 feet tall _ and entirely computer generated , although he interacts with the film 's human stars with a never-before-seen complexity .
the brunt of the criticism has focused on jar jar binks , member of an underwater alien race called the gungans , who theoretically provides the film 's comic relief .
`` episode i _ the phantom menace '' boasts completely realized alien worlds , 60 new species to inhabit them and dozens of never-before-seen vehicles to travel upon and between them .
the movie 's most impressive setpiece is a 10-minute pod race on the desert planet of tatooine .
inspired by the `` ben hur '' chariot race sequence , the high-speed contest involves rickety , jet engine-powered `` hot rods '' that zip along a few feet above the rocky surface .
the race 's highly kinetic visuals were overseen by john knoll , a cg genius who was one of the authors of the popular photoshop software system .
but the loud , varied , almost living pod race sound showcases burtt 's wizardry like nothing before .

cataracts , a clouding of the lens in the eye , is the leading cause of blindness in china now .
although two million cataract patients had their eyesight restored through surgery in the last decade , medical services are still greatly needed by patients living in remote and poor areas , sun said .
`` we have planned to provide 1.75 million cataract surgeries in the 1996-2000 period , '' said chen yuan of the federation 's rehabilitation department .
his adopted family worries about john as he gets older ; he had a mild heart attack not long ago , and he had surgery for cataracts .
what you can do : `` surgery is the only proven way to treat cataracts , '' says dr . richard e . braunstein , assistant clinical professor of ophthalmology at columbia-presbyterian medical center in new york .
turning to the blind , the minister said that there are about 12 million blind people in the country and of which 80 percent have incurred blindness due to cataract which is curable by simple surgery .
cataract patients are treated free of charge through cataract surgery performed in eye camps , organized by government and non-governmental organizations , he added .
extracapsular cataract extraction is a safe and effective method to treat cataracts , a common disease , which can result in blindness .
the tests routinely given to patients before cataract surgery do not make the operation any safer , and medicare could save nearly $ 150 million a year if they were conducted only when needed , a study found .
in the study , nine hospitals and walk-in clinics randomly assigned 19,250 cataract surgery patients to the test or no-test group .

the united states was one of seven countries voting '' no '' when 120 countries approved the treaty to establish the international criminal court in july 1998 in rome .
over clinton administration objections , agreement was reached at a u.n . conference in 1998 to establish an international criminal court , known informally as the icc .
the united states was one of seven countries voting '' no '' when 120 countries approved a treaty establishing the international criminal court in july 1998 in rome .
the court , which was created by a treaty signed in rome in july 1998 as a permanent body to try war criminals , may come into existence by 2002 , legal experts say .
the international law commission adopted the rome statute for establishing the icc on july 17 , 1998 .
in 1998 , iraq , libya and the united states were among seven countries that voted against a treaty to create the court .
william pace , head of a coalition of more than 1,000 grass-roots groups backing the court , said tuesday the proposals would undermine the independence , effectiveness and credibility of the court .
american officials felt the treaty yielded too much prosecutorial power to the new court , leaving u.s . troops and citizens vulnerable to politically motivated prosecutions .
this month the united states formally introduced proposals , aimed at insulating americans from the court 's jurisdiction , to the commission preparing for its operation .
under the treaty , the court can exercise jurisdiction when either the country where the crime takes place or the country whose nationals commit the crime have ratified the statute .
the rome statute also barred the security council from interfering with the court taking a case unless all five permanent council members and the majority of the 15 -member council approved .
pace , head of the coalition for an international criminal court , said the united states tried but failed to exempt americans from prosecution during the treaty negotiations .
that scenario may not seem far-fetched now that the united nations is in the process of establishing a permanent international criminal court aimed at holding accountable those responsible for actions deemed to be war crimes or crimes against humanity .
while offering millions to track down war crimes suspects in the balkans , the united states is trying to carve out a blanket exemption protecting american soldiers from being hunted down and prosecuted by the new u.n . court .
'' if an iraqi military commander committed crimes against humanity against iraqi citizens , iraq as a nonparty state could deny the court the authority to prosecute .
only 10 countries have ratified the proposal ; five dozen are needed to create the court .
nothing would prevent the court from going after americans even if the united states is not a member , or '' nonparty state . ''
'' we do not believe our armed forces should be subject to surrender to the court because we are a nonparty to the court , '' scheffer said .
'' so long as there is breath in me , the u.s . will never -- i repeat , never -- allow its national security decisions to be judged by an international criminal court , '' he said .
nonetheless , it is helping draft the court 's rules of procedure and evidence .
the court was created to deal with the most heinous crimes -- genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
under the treaty , the court will step in only when states are unwilling or unable to dispense justice .
the united states objects that american citizens can be subject to the court 's jurisdiction if an alleged crime is committed in a country that ratified the treaty -- even if the united states is not a party .
helms ' legislation would require u.s . personnel to be '' immunized '' from the court 's jurisdiction before the united states participated in any u.n . peacekeeping operations .
'' it 's not going to stop the court .
nonetheless , the united states is helping draft the court 's rules of procedure and evidence .
a bill working its way through congress '' will worsen our negotiating position '' during negotiations on the court , ambassador david scheffer told the house international relations committee .
such issues must be resolved before the united states moves forward with further participation with the court , smith said .
the spanish judge who sought the extradition of former chilean dictator augusto pinochet called saturday for nations to ratify a treaty creating the world 's first permanent war crimes court and criticized the united states for opposing it .
'' it is important to emphasize that the international criminal court will not try countries , but individuals . ''
'' yet , it is fiercely opposed to the creation of the international criminal court . ''
at least , this seemed to be america 's position for the last four years as bill clinton and madeleine albright touted the establishment of the international criminal court as a key foreign-policy aim .
though international meetings on the icc began in 1994 , the united states failed to decide key issues _ would it back the court ?
yet an historic opportunity to shape the court in america 's image was lost .
what we got instead was a court america can not agree to _ at least not until its good faith has been tested over years .
after triumph at the ottawa land - mines conference _ where they brushed aside u.s . military needs in korea _ a caucus of so-called like-minded states , under canadian and norwegian leadership , demanded an unfettered court .
moreover , the european union had also hailed an independent court as the hallmark of its post- bosnia try for a unified foreign and security policy .
u.s . negotiators made no objection to the complaint system that allows any state party , friend or foe , to refer investigations to the court without security council approval .
yet washington vehemently opposed an independent prosecutor out of fear he might start investigations on his own motion , subject only to court approval .
indeed , exposure of u.s . troops and commanders to judgment by an international court free to decide for itself what is a `` disproportionate '' use of force -lrb- and hence a war crime -rrb- should concern washington .
in order to secure defendants , evidence and funding , the new court must rely on the goodwill of many states _ but foremost among them , the world 's one remaining superpower .
unless it acts scrupulously , the court will never win financial backing .
many states hope that the united nations will fund the new court in its first years of operation .
while other states will resist explicit american conditions on tribunal funding -lrb- thanks to the ongoing u.n . dues battle -rrb- , they must recognize that the united states will never bankroll an abusive court .
the u.s . military role in international security will not be altered by the evangelism of an international court .
after all , the court was set up to address the horrors of contemporary civil wars , not cut down america 's preeminence in the post- cold war world .
united nations _ the united states , isolated among the nations of the world , is going into a crucial conference monday on the soon-to-be-established international criminal court still asking for changes its charter .
the united states is trying to protect american soldiers and officials from falling under the court 's jurisdiction .
but all members of the european union and other members of nato support the court and have told the united states that there should be no attempt to reopen debate on how it will work .
the clinton administration has been unable to win support for the court from the pentagon and sen . jesse helms , the north carolina republican who is chairman of the senate foreign relations committee .
he has declared that the court treaty would be dead on arrival if submitted to his panel .
in rome , 120 nations voted for the court .
in the last two years , more than 95 nations have signed the statute establishing the court and 12 have ratified it , with 60 ratifications needed for the court to begin functioning .
until dec . 31 , countries can sign the international criminal court treaty and ratify later .
in a recent interview here , secretary of state madeleine albright indicated that there was no chance that the united states would sign this year unless the court statute is changed .
european and other diplomats here say that most nations would like to find a way to include the united states because the court would be considerably weakened and undervalued without american involvement .
critics of the court object to what they say is the legal authority it would have without an acceptable constitutional base .
john bolton , a former assistant secretary of state for international organizations in the bush administration , calls the establishment of the court `` a stealth approach to eroding our constitutionalism '' _ for all branches of american government .
`` the 1945 nuremberg tribunal established forever the personal responsibility and accountability of those who are guilty of the worst of crimes .
he said it is `` indeed gratifying '' to note that at last the international community has recognized the importance of setting up of a permanent international criminal court to bring those criminals to justice .
the official acknowledged the united nations had no way to compel national courts to prosecute the cases , but said the future international criminal court might have jurisdiction over peacekeepers who commit war crimes .
in 1998 , the recruitment and use of children younger than 15 was proposed as a war crime under the statute of the proposed international criminal court .
he supports the formation of a permanent international criminal court , which was approved by treaty last year to try individuals accused of being responsible for war crimes and genocide .
russia became the 112th country to sign the treaty setting up an international criminal court to try those accused of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
london , august 25 -lrb- xinhua -rrb- -- britain on friday published a draft legislation to join an international criminal court intended to try perpetrators of crimes against humanity .
from his bench in the hague , where the court and the separate balkans war crimes tribunal are based , he has watched a new body and practice of international law evolve .
britain had been entangled in 1998 in the case of augusto pinochet , the former chilean leader who was arrested in london when spain said it wanted him tried for crimes against humanity .
erbakan 's lawyers said his jailing would prevent him from defending two other cases .

since shsehf sror bought a supermarket and a cafeteria from the collective farm kibbutz on the golan heights six months ago , he has been wondering how long he can keep them .
kibbutz is an agricultural farming community based on common ownership of the means of production and consumption .
at the kibbutz , jiang visited the dining hall , the home of a kibbutz member , after being briefed on the history and current situation of the collective farm .

prime minister benjamin netanyahu criticized the ruling , saying that it made a distinction between kibbutz members and other israelis , israel tv 's channel two said friday .
kibbutz leaders , in turn , accused netanyahu of pandering to the three religious parties that are key members of his shaky coalition .
as israel is warming up for resuming peace talks with syria , sror said he would not be surprised if being told some day to abandon the kibbutz .
korda , who came from britain and settled down in golan 12 years ago , estimated that 90 percent of the 260 members in this kibbutz share her view .
kibbutz en ziwan , which has 60 families , is situated merely two or three kilometers away from the current israeli - syrian border .
photos hanging on the wall of the cafeteria depicted a scene of what happened to the kibbutz - women and children were being evacuated by buses and people were rushing to underground bomb shelters .
in the afternoon , jiang visited the en gedi kibbutz , about 90 kilometers southeast of jerusalem .
it is not -lrb- changing -rrb- for the better , '' said micha hertz , chairman of israel 's kibbutz industries association .
in israel , 185,000 members of the kibbutz communities who strictly live up to the principles of socialism are making use of multimedia networks to strengthen their organization , and to fend off the wave of liberalism and individualism .
israel 's first kibbutz was established in 1908 on the shores of the sea of galiee as the realization of the ideology of the communal .
there are now 275 kibbutz communities in israel , scattering throughout the country from the golan heights in the north to the red sea in the south .

former concorde pilot david brister , who flew the aircraft from 1976 to 1982 , said other aspects of its design may have made it vulnerable to engine problems .
steve fushelberger , a spokesman for rolls royce in london , said wednesday the engine has functioned without trouble since the first concorde passenger flights in 1976 .
there is the first for a concorde plane to crash since its birth on march 2 , 1969 and its maiden commercial flight in 1976 .
in 1830 , the first passenger railroad in the united states began service between baltimore and elliott 's mills , md .

french investigators focused wednesday on the air france concorde 's powerful rolls royce engines -- one of which was repaired just before tuesday 's doomed flight -- as the possible cause of the first-ever concorde crash .
a last-minute repair was made at the request of the pilot , but right after take off tuesday , the same engine was trailing flames .
the airline 's statement did not indicate whether the repair could have led to the catastrophe .
even without the repair to the thruster , flight af4590 had been cleared for departure tuesday because it still met a technical level of tolerance allowed by the manufacturer , air france said .
since a replacement was not available , workers made the repair using a part from a backup concorde , the airline said .
the pilot told the tower that he could not stop the flight and was trying to reach le bourget , a nearby airport .
andre turcat , the pilot who flew the first test flight of the concorde in 1969 , said wednesday he believed the cause of the accident was '' much more serious '' than just a malfunctioning engine .
a stall occurs when there is insufficient airspeed over the wings to create the lift that sustains an aircraft 's flight .
though the concorde flies higher and faster than passenger jetliners , its four rolls royce olympus engines do not differ greatly from slower and lower-flying models on other commercial jets .
the concorde is the only commercial jetliner to use afterburners , which provide extra thrust .
at supersonic speeds , air entering the concorde 's engines is slowed down before it is combined with fuel and combusted for thrust , like in other commercial jetliners .
concordes take off at subsonic speeds and do not break the speed of sound until they are over the ocean .
because of their unique design , they take off faster and steeper than other jets -- a fact some aviation experts pointed out after tuesday 's crash .
'' concorde is unusual in that the two engines on each wing are very close together .
'' but with concorde the engines are so close that it is possible one could affect the other and then you have a much more serious situation. ''
reluctant to trust an engine with a broken part , the pilot of the doomed air france concorde delayed his flight for repairs , a terse airline statement said wednesday .
terrified witnesses below watched the concorde 's distinctive needle nose point downward .
although this fell within the manufacturer 's technical tolerances , the pilot ordered the part replaced before he would take off , the airline 's statement said .
thrusters , which are used to slow the plane upon landing , were found from a spare concorde and the repair was made .
a late connecting flight further delayed takeoff from charles de gaulle airport , the brief air france communique said .
'' only after the spare part was replaced and the luggage loaded did the captain make the decision to depart , '' it concluded .
the veteran concorde captain said he was trying to reach le bourget , a smaller and more accessible airport than charles de gaulle .
as crash details trickled in slowly , authorities ordered all air france concorde flights indefinitely grounded .
france remained in shock at the loss of life in their beloved concorde .
two recovered flight recorders were being examined .
but british airways resumed its london - new york concorde flights wednesday after briefly grounding them for safety checks .
and gayssot said that despite the crash , he still believes the concorde has a place in the modern world .
'' the concorde without a doubt died yesterday , '' le figaro , a leading paris daily , wrote .
this was the first concorde crash after three decades of service .
air france said that when the concorde took off , its left reactor was on fire .
concorde carries only 100 passengers , with two seats on each side of the aisle .
the concorde 's 100 -seat cabin is so small it is hard to work without your neighbors peeking over your shoulder .
tuesday 's flight to new york , with 33 of the 100 seats filled , was more than two hours late departing .
its older relation has 100 seats , can manage only 4,000 miles and is 25 per cent slower .
british airways insists that demand for seats on its concorde has not dropped off after the air france crash a week ago , despite a series of embarrassing problems since then with the british fleet of supersonic jets .
british airways resumed its concorde flights after a single day 's pause after the air france flight crashed outside paris on july 25 , killing 113 people .
some days this year are worse , but the airline pointed to one recent post-crash concorde flight from new york that arrived with 82 passengers , compared to 32 on the same date a year ago .
the first plane assigned to the flight was pulled after mechanics decided more work was needed on a recently replaced engine , and another concorde was rolled out .
on saturday , emergency services were out on the runway to attend to the landing of a concorde at heathrow after a report of a loud bang in an engine .
the day 's second flight got only as far as gander , newfoundland , where it made an emergency landing after fumes that smelled like fuel got into the cabin .
the french disaster was the first in 25 years of commercial operations for concorde .
but because the concorde makes far fewer flights than most aircraft , that one crash gave it one of the worst safety records for passenger aircraft .
aboard the concorde _ ninety minutes out of heathrow , i press my nose against the porthole-sized window and gaze upon the distant world below .
except for a handful of astronauts and military pilots , we concorde passengers are flying higher and faster than any other humans .
three decades after it first punched through the sound barrier , concorde remains , in every meaningful sense , the pinnacle of commercial air travel .
in an age when flying increasingly resembles travel by greyhound bus _ at least for those in coach _ concorde is a throaty , head -turning , envy-inducing lamborghini .
`` in a very real sense , concorde was our apollo program , '' said mike bannister , the chief concorde pilot for british airways .
concorde made its maiden test flight in the spring of 1969 as apollo 11 was fueling up for its rendezvous with the sea of tranquility .
one of the joys of flying concorde is looking down and seeing a jumbo jet on the same flight path 5 miles below .
but noise and environmental concerns severely constrained concorde 's market .
by most estimates , it costs an airline five to eight times as much to fly a passenger across the atlantic aboard concorde as in a modern jumbo , such as a boeing 777 or airbus a340 .
at heathrow airport 's frenetic terminal 4 , i stride smugly past the subsonic riffraff in their long , snaking lines and continue to the far end of the concourse , where concorde has an exclusive check-in counter .
`` would you like to see concorde ? ''
as chubby jumbo jets waddle past on the tarmac , i ca n't help but notice how much the dart-shaped , delta-winged concorde resembles the pan am spaceship in `` 2001 : a space odyssey . ''
after years of flying in the cavernous bellies of jumbo jets , i 'm startled at how compact the cabin seems .
concorde has been taking off from heathrow twice a day for the last 23 years , and it still draws a crowd .
it 's the vertical speed indicator , which flickers crazily for a moment as a shock wave moves past the concorde 's outside sensor plate .
the wines aboard concorde are extraordinary _ the champagne is rotated among selections that include 1990 dom perignon and 1988 tattinger , comtes de champagne _ but i notice that i seem to be the only one imbibing .

his trip was delayed after air france suspended all its concorde flights until the airline is convinced the planes are safe .
british airways , the only other airline that flies the concorde , resumed its new york to london service wednesday after having canceled some flights tuesday .
passengers who are normally consigned to economy class might smirk to hear the concorde , which costs more than $ 10,000 for a full-fare roundtrip ticket , described as a business tool .
air france says two-thirds of its concorde passengers are traveling on business , while the rest are celebrities , the superrich or vacationers like members of the german tour group who died in tuesday 's crash .
for business executives , the advantage of the concorde , which cruises twice as high as conventional jets and , at 1,350 mph , twice as fast , is not just the time saved in the air .
british airways and air france have designed their concorde services so passengers can avoid the increasingly common hassles of modern jet travel .
concorde passengers can arrive a half hour before the flight departs and are whisked through check-in and immigration .
celebrities like the concorde 's exclusivity because it separates them from the common folk on commercial flights .
the concorde 's speed allows executives to put in a full day of work in london , hop on the 7 p.m . concorde and arrive back in new york the same day at 6 p.m .
the only reason he flew the concorde wednesday was because he had a meeting in london wednesday and another in new york thursday .
the concorde also allows travelers to europe to arrive early enough to connect to other destinations the same day .
indeed , the concorde is the only daytime flight that arrives on the continent in the afternoon .
besides , one of the concorde 's dirty secrets is that few of its regulars pay the top fare of more than $ 10,000 roundtrip .
passengers also use frequent flyer miles to upgrade to the concorde .
`` it is not as if it is either the concorde or they are going to swim , '' richard nigosian , president of bond street travel in manhattan , said of the customers he books on the concorde .
britain 's decision on tuesday to ground the concorde following the first fatal crash of the supersonic transport plane probably marks the end of the line for what was almost certainly the loftiest niche in commercial aviation history .
concorde was never a significant factor in aviation except for those willing to pay up to $ 11,000 for a round-trip ticket between new york and london or paris .
concorde 's conversion to museum status will be as much a matter of economics as safety .
flying at more than 1,300 miles an hour , concorde was largely restricted to over-the-ocean routes to avoid inflicting its sonic boom on earthlings .
concorde 's retirement may be unique in transportation annals for lowering maximum speeds .
supersonic speed has remained a formidable barrier for most airlines , and no successor to concorde is within sight .
the new version , concorde two , will carry 300 passengers , have a range of more than 6,500 miles and travel at two and a half times the speed of sound .
under the new design , concorde two will have a cockpit at the rear of the plane close to the tailfin , which will spell an end for concorde 's 's distinctive drooping nose .
at present , concorde registers 120 decibels on take-off , louder than a rock concert .
flights from london to los angeles and tokyo are important sources of revenue , but are beyond concorde 's capabilities .
the concorde , which crosses the atlantic at 1,350 mph , has been considered among the world 's safest planes .
by comparison , the concorde , the fastest commercial aircraft , has a top speed of about 1,800 mph .
someone who did better at high school algebra than i figured out that since the concorde was moving at 1,330 mph , the ball traveled 8.5 miles , a world record .
the concorde flies at some 55,000 feet , nearly twice ordinary passenger jets , and travels at nearly 1,350 miles per hour , twice the speed of sound .
and the plane 's extraordinary speed of 1,350 mph comes at a price : the concorde is a gas guzzler .
the concorde , which can fly at 1,350 miles per hour at some 60,000 feet above sea-level , has long been regarded by france as proof of its technological prowess .
for business executives , the advantage of the concorde , which cruises twice as high as conventional jets and , at 1,350 mph , twice as fast , is not just the time saved in the air .
with flames and smoke streaking from its engines , an air france concorde carrying german tourists to new york for a caribbean cruise crashed into a hotel outside paris shortly after takeoff tuesday .

paris _ a new york -bound supersonic concorde jet carrying 109 people crashed into a small hotel shortly after takeoff here tuesday afternoon , killing all those on board and at least four people on the ground .
one other concorde had been grounded in london last week because of cracks in its wing .
the crash came a day after british airways acknowledged it had grounded one of its seven concorde jets at heathrow airport in london because cracks were detected in its wings .
round-trip seats on the paris - new york concorde cost $ 9,000 , about 25 percent more than normal first-class fares .
the ntsb was invited becuase the concorde provides regular scheduled service to the united states .
the ntsb conducted two preliminary investigations in recent years involving the concorde .
atlanta - traffic came to a halt around hartsfield international airport as the concorde taxied to the runway for its first-ever takeoff from atlanta .
another chartered concorde landed here in 1997 carrying european vacationers on an around-the-world dash .
the agreement does not allow delta to book seats on air france 's concorde flights , though .
a delta spokesman said tuesday the airline has hoped to expand the `` code share '' deal to include concorde flights .
the supersonic concorde 's visits to atlanta demonstrate the public fascination , economic obstacles and environmental controversies the concorde has evoked during its 31 years of flight .
the concorde has been a perennial money loser for air france and british airways even though almost all 100 of each flight 's seats are typically filled by passengers paying nearly $ 10,000 apiece .
each concorde burns more than its own weight in fuel during every trans-atlantic crossing .
that 's more than a b747-400 , which travels at slightly less than half the concorde 's speed but can transport four times as many people and far more cargo .
the concorde had never had a fatal accident before tuesday .
but a former flight dispatcher for air france said the planes fly at the edge of their aerodynamic capabilities all the time .
also , the aerodynamic characteristics of the concorde 's triangle-shaped delta wing make it unstable at slow speeds _ especially in a situation like the paris crash , when one or more engines apparently failed on takeoff .
concorde wings do n't have slats on the leading edges or traditional flaps on the trailing edges to aid low-speed handling .
a concorde typically flies at altitudes up to 60,000 feet _ about twice that of most passenger jets .
and it takes just three hours , 23 minutes to fly from new york to paris .
`` flying has been a big part of my life , and the concorde was my only chance to go supersonic , '' said the skylarks ' vason , 70 , a former air force bomber and transport pilot .
`` i imagine -lrb- tuesday 's crash -rrb- will be the end of the concorde program , and i find that very sad. ''
it was the only crash of a concorde since the world 's first supersonic passenger plane went into commercial operation in 1976 .
he added that the concorde that crashed tuesday entered service in 1980 and had undergone a mechanical check up as recently as last friday .
a photograph of the ill-fated concorde in the air , taken by a young hungarian plane -spotter , showed flames stretching some 60 feet behind the aircraft .
eric udel , a new york musician who had just finished touring europe with the blue brothers jazz band , said he looked up and saw the concorde on fire .
on tuesday night , the french transport minister , jean-claude gayssot , said he had asked the civil aviation authority to cancel all concorde flights wednesday .
in london , a spokesman for british airways , the only airline apart from air france to fly the plane , said that tuesday evening 's flights to and from new york had also been canceled .
but a spokesman for the british civil aviation board said it had no intention of grounding the concorde .
earlier this month , british airways grounded one of its seven concordes after cracks were found in its wings , but the remaining six in its supersonic fleet continue to fly .
on at least three occasions , the rubber tires on the concorde 's landing gear have exploded upon landing .
his trip was delayed after air france suspended all its concorde flights until the airline is convinced the planes are safe .

most fly so often that they or their companies have cut deals with the airlines for discounts of as much as 30 percent , or the price of a business-class ticket , which on air france is $ 7,050 .
passengers also use frequent flyer miles to upgrade to the concorde .
`` it is not as if it is either the concorde or they are going to swim , '' richard nigosian , president of bond street travel in manhattan , said of the customers he books on the concorde .

the resort , opened on oct . 24 , 1997 , is club med 's newest addition to its current 120 villages in 36 countries worldwide , along with one in cuba that also opened last year .
general manager mehdi serrour and club med ceo philippe bourgougnov played hosts to the guests enjoying the resort 's lush grasslands , clear waters and above all , the complimentary three-day , two -night stay at the resort .
at the gathering , serrour would not say what the extravagant club med cost to build , but a corporate client figured that the cost could have reached more than rp 15 billion .
its hotel list includes the rasa indah , sedona bintan lagoon , bintan lagoon beach and resort , rbcm , banyan tree bintan , mana mana beach club and the nirwana garden resort .
it would n't be club med if we cut costs .
i 'd say we 'll see more and more of the club med logo ...
`` europeans , because they come from so far off , take full advantage of their time and vacation here. ''
serrour reiterated that club med was not currently focusing on finance .
club med around the world boasts 76,000 beds , 12 villages in asia , 89 in europe and 17 in north america .
at the press conference on may 9 , bourgougnov , club med 's ceo , said 14 percent of club med 's business came from asian general managers .
he lists the facilities worldwide -- among them about 14,000 service staff , 40 different sports and 950 sailboats .
franz kafka was born in prague , czechoslovakia , in 1883 and died a month before his 41st birthday , having long suffered from tuberculosis .
kafka was born in prague in 1883 and wrote in his native german language .
cigarettes are her vice and , periodically , she 'll step out into the afternoon cold for a `` burn one '' break , a phrase franz kafka surely did n't hear in the coffee houses of prague .
it 's a world as far from franz kafka as the yukon river is from prague , but in one passage kimberley joins the crimes of the new world to her ancestor 's ancient sigh .
city councilors named a square after prague 's literary son , franz kafka , on tuesday despite earlier protest from the district 's mayor who said the move would have terrified the writer .
kafka .
kimberley kafka is the first cousin - twice removed of franz kafka , and is herself a published writer of nearly 20 years .
it seemed like the only thing i could do without too much of a struggle , '' the 42-year-old kafka says .
`` i started writing stories in kindergarten ; i had n't even made any connection to franz kafka . ''
kafka works out of a tiny attic office where the furniture is old , made of wood , and passed down from the non- kafka side of the family .
wearing jeans and a large purple sweater , kimberley kafka appears far more defined by her upbeat , american first name than her dark , haunted last name .
only in college did she learn there even was a franz kafka .
as both his fiction and his diaries revealed , kafka was the most tortured of artists , touched by everything from jewish despair to the bureaucratic state .
in kafka 's first novel , `` amerika , '' a teen-age european caught up in a sex scandal is shipped by his parents to the new world .
he 's a typically passive kafka character , dragged through a variety of jobs and friends in the east before hitching up with a theater company and boarding a train to oklahoma .
according to several biographies , `` amerika `` was based in part on kimberley kafka 's grandfather , otto kafka .
he was franz kafka 's first cousin and he apparently ran away from home as a teen-ager , worked on a ship and settled in the united states .
franz kafka never spent a moment in america and he did n't finish the novel .
whatever kimberley kafka knows about her father 's side of the family , she 's learned from books .
by the time her father , philip kafka , was born , the past had been wiped out with the savagery of a pogrom .
my mother was christian and my dad was not born into any religion .
philip kafka ended up in jacksonville , fla . , where frances kimberley kafka was born .
kafka read like a demon , everything from children 's stories to shakespeare .
no franz kafka books were in the house and at no time was it pointed out that her father had a cousin with a kindred passion .
neither her parents , her friends nor her teachers ever mentioned kafka .
a fellow student asked if she was related to that kafka .
she maintained for the longest time that there was absolutely no connection , '' kafka says .
kimberley kafka was straightening out a bookcase in the living room when she came upon a packet of letters to her father at the back of a shelf .
they were from a biographer , asking questions about otto kafka .
`` before i was born my mother wanted another child .
kafka has never met her biological mother and does n't want to .
had kimberley looked carefully at a picture of the young franz kafka she might have suspected sooner .
`` she was furious , '' recalls novelist madison smartt bell , a friend of kafka 's and a fellow hollins student .
and while most teachers avoided mentioning franz kafka in the classroom , at least one could n't help himself .
the professor was very old at that point -- he had to be in his early 80s , and he was a kafka fanatic .
in college , she read her first kafka book , `` the trial . ''
kimberley kafka lives within as few boundaries as possible ; her ancestor imagined a world of closed doors or doors that simply opened to other doors .
out of obligation rather than pleasure , she read kafka .
kafka began working on `` true north `` in 1997 and completed her first draft the following year .
kafka has never read `` amerika , '' but `` true north `` also tells the story of a character who flees to the west .
the small plaza in the heart of downtown , just off the famous old town square , was named after kafka because his house stood there before it was demolished in 1911 .
the mayor of the first district , jan buergermeister , protested the proposal in february , arguing that naming a square after kafka would go against the very essence of the writer 's work .
kafka is best known for his absurd novels like the trial or the castle .
franz kafka was born in prague , czechoslovakia , in 1883 and died a month before his 41st birthday , having long suffered from tuberculosis .
kafka was born in prague in 1883 and wrote in his native german language .
by the time her father , philip kafka , was born , the past had been wiped out with the savagery of a pogrom .
my mother was christian and my dad was not born into any religion .
philip kafka ended up in jacksonville , fla . , where frances kimberley kafka was born .
`` before i was born my mother wanted another child .
but unlike kimberley , he grew up jewish and franz kafka was a name worth dropping .
as both his fiction and his diaries revealed , kafka was the most tortured of artists , touched by everything from jewish despair to the bureaucratic state .
for years , her own background was as inscrutable as the castle in her ancestor 's classic novel .
bailey lockhart is a maine native with a tragic background who ends up in alaska , working as a bush pilot and living among native americans .
and after seeing him play so many nice guys since his 1987 oscar win for `` wall street , '' it 's also fun to have him play an even more evil version of his gordon gekko character .
he received a best actor oscar in 1987 for his role as gordon gekko in `` wall street `` .
but the changes have not improved the piece , and _ like the hitchcock film _ it looses steam and falls apart .
her character is poorly written , and she seems such a shallow , spoiled ninny that she fails to be the sympathetic center she 's supposed to be .

the harlem globetrotters began talks thursday aimed at returning the touring basketball performers to cuba for the first time in nearly 50 years .
the plan is to have the globetrotters stay for a full week and also hold basketball clinics for cuban youth .
lynette woodard , the all-time collegiate scoring leader and first woman to play for the harlem globetrotters , today announced she is retiring from professional basketball and returning to the university of kansas as an assistant coach .
but larry bird could play basketball , and monday he received the ultimate confirmation of that when he was elected to the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame .
but he had a tremendous knowledge of the game of basketball , and he was settled in the way he played .
`` his love for the game and how effective he was at playing basketball kind of made him understand that basketball had to be a big part of his life , '' daniels said. ''
at the basketball hall of fame , which draws visitors from around the world , you learn that dr . james naismith invented the sport in 1891 to vanquish winter blahs .
`` we are really hoping to play here. ''
he said he hopes that a cuban national team will be able to play the globetrotters at madison square garden in new york .
naismith wanted to give bored students at the ymca international training school -lrb- now springfield college -rrb- an exciting game they could play indoors with minimal equipment : a soccer ball and two peach baskets .
within a few years alumni of the school , most of whom became ymca directors , had introduced naismith 's new sport around the country and to many parts of the world .
historical displays focus on the game 's early years , noting , for instance , the role of the harlem globetrotters in popularizing the sport .
globetrotters : abe saperstein , a former chicago social worker , founded the harlem globetrotters in 1927 .
the globetrotters , founded by abe saperstein and inman jackson , started barnstorming as the `` savoy big five '' in 1926 .
globetrotters : abe saperstein , a former chicago social worker , founded the harlem globetrotters in 1927 .
there was no small gamble in taking cooper , due solely to the omnipotent presence of the globetrotters and their owner / founder , abe saperstein , who had a vice hold on all the black basketball players .

paris , february 5 -lrb- xinhua -rrb- -- american teenager jennifer capriati will return to tennis next week after an absence of more than a year , organisers of the paris women 's open said on monday .
capriati , 19 , who has not played competitive tennis since november 1994 , has been given a wild card to take part in the paris tournament which starts on february 13 .
the feeling of camaraderie in team tennis intrigues him , so he wanted to play a part , no matter how small .
he played tennis every day until it got dark , and suddenly he started winning .
rain delayed the first day of play at the u.s . tennis center in new york .
capriati was leading gagliardi 6-4 , 1 -0 when rain delayed the first day of play at the u.s . open at the u.s . tennis center in new york .
tennis was reintroduced as an olympic sport only in 1988 , after a 64-year absence .
capriati joined a field that includes french open champion steffi graf , defending wimbledon champion jana novotna , anna kournikova and amanda coetzer , last year 's runner-up here to graf .
capriati , 23 , was beaten in the second round at wimbledon on wednesday by seda noorlander of the netherlands 6-1 , 6-3 .
this will be capriati 's fifth appearance in the exhibition event , which she won in 1991 and '93 .
`` sport is in general .
stolle has garnered world rankings as high as 50 in singles play and 14 in doubles .
suddenly a sport that had never been a top priority became fun .
which he did , at the us open , and emerged successful in doubles play .
`` you play these matches and sometimes you get so involved that it means everything , '' stolle said .
a few years later , davenport feared capriati , the image : `` i 'm gon na be careful .
davenport said , `` it 's really strange _ and great for her _ that jennifer and i wound up in the australian open semifinals .
capriati , who has risen from no . 101 to no . 21 in two years , was matching davenport 's firepower , shot for shot .
but in the tiebreaker , it was davenport 's harmless-looking , changeup kicker second serve that did capriati in , making two vital points .
capriati overhit them , the first a backhand that looked a winner that would have given her a minibreak _ but it just missed the sideline so that davenport was at 3-3 .
the lone mini , to 5-4 , went to davenport on capriati 's error , concluding a blistering exchange of 21 strokes .
davenport fooled capriati with another slow 66 miles per hour kicker to 6 -4 .
nine years had passed since the ill-starred capriati last ventured this far in a major championship , the us open semifinal that she barely lost to monica seles .
in 23 minutes , davenport had pocketed the opening set , running up a 5 - 1 lead and splintered capriati 's serve to start the second .
the depth of davenport 's weighty ground strokes and her dynamite serve killed capriati .
but capriati , ever a fighter , came roaring back to score her first service break 2-1 at the half-hour mark , subsided 2-4 , then began to outhit her faltering foe to catch her at 4-4 .
`` jennifer had me going .
jennifer capriati was a wimbledon semifinalist in 1991 , while lindsay davenport was struggling through the junior draw .
capriati also was playing in the u.s . open semifinals in '91 , one year before davenport won the junior title on those same courts .
but though davenport did n't turn pro until three years after her colleague _ and with much less fanfare _ the 24-year-old californian has long bypassed capriati , accomplishing things the former phenom still dreams about .
on monday , davenport again showed her dominance , ending capriati 's best wimbledon since 1993 with a 6-3 , 6-3 victory .
capriati made three grand slam semifinal appearances in 1990 and '91 , then reached the semis this year in australia .
the 6 - 2 -lcb- davenport drilled seven aces past capriati and had 18 unreturnable serves .
`` hopefully , i 'll have another opportunity to play better , at least play the best i can. ''

leading candidates appear to be the telecaster brothers mcenroe , john and patrick , and harold solomon , presently coaching jennifer capriati .
capriati came to rome with her father , stefano , her boyfriend and the atp tour player xavier malisse and a new coach , rikard bergh , whom capriati considers helpful but temporary .
under the coaching of harold solomon , she feels her game keeps improving .
according to both parties , they did so because capriati wanted a full-time coach and solomon wanted to spend more time with his family in fort lauderdale , fla . , and less time on the road .

abercrombie & fitch began life in 1892 as a high-end camping , fishing and hunting gear store in new york city .
abercrombie sold 15 percent of its shares to the public three years ago , and spun-off completely from limited inc . in may 1998 .
all the while , abercrombie has steadily grown , from 25 stores in 1988 to almost 200 now .
it 's a different story back at simon 's home in raleigh , n.c . `` let me put it this way _ my 14-year-old sister loves abercrombie , my 17-year-old sister is over it .

more significantly , old navy , the fun , lower-cost clothier begun by gap a mere five years ago , has become so popular so quickly that it is challenging gap stores ' primacy .
still , the 1,021 stores under the flagship gap name must start to perform better or risk becoming dead weight .

he was the title character in `` tale of genji , '' the nearly 1 , 000-year-old love story that is sometimes described as the world 's first novel and is usually considered japan 's greatest literary achievement .
but prince genji is a central figure in japanese culture , and he never had a wit of trouble with the law _ perhaps in part because he never existed .
yet if prince genji is an unusual cultural icon , his latest chronicler is if anything even more startling .
jakucho setouchi , a 77-year-old buddhist nun with shaven head and twinkling eyes , has translated `` tale of genji '' into modern japanese and turned it into a huge best seller .
`` so , yes , ` tale of genji ' is relevant to today 's people .
so ms . setouchi , who was already a famous author and renowned for her racy novels , decided to tackle `` genji . ''
a `` genji '' play has come out , and ms . setouchi is a television star on the national lecture circuit .
her temple _ for all its idyllic gardens and lovely antiques _ seems to have compromised its serenity with all the fans coming to see japan 's most famous nun .
`` tale of genji '' was read aloud to the emperor , and its mix of plot and heartache and psychology _ a bit like jane austen _ have made it a hit ever since .
`` ` tale of genji ' is filled with psychological themes , '' said hideyo ueda , the director of the japan classic literature research institute in tokyo .
ms . setouchi argues , in contrast to many other critics , that the key figures in `` tale of genji '' are the women whom the prince uses and discards .
while genji 's liaisons are normally described as seductions , ms . setouchi scoffs at that .
`` men are very free now to have girlfriends , and women to have boyfriends , and it 's getting back to the way it was in genji 's time , '' ms . setouchi said .
the inevitable nominees from the distant past would include queen elizabeth i , joan of arc and shikibu murasaki , whose `` tales of genji '' was the first realistic novel .
kumar said that javanese immigrants carried the panji tales as far away as japan , where , she believes , they became the basis of `` the tale of genji '' by lady murasaki shikibu .
kano script made possible the development of a secular japanese literature , beginning with such late heian classics as lady murasaki 's `` tales of genji . ''
it shows the shureimon gate of the castle on the front and a scene from the epic 11th century japanese novel tale of genji on the back .
the first recorded wraith appears in the 10th-century `` tale of genji , '' but many of japan 's traditional ghost stories come from the bunka-bunsei period in the early 19th century .
while english-speakers can still enjoy the 14th-century `` canterbury tales , '' most japanese can not understand works written 100 years ago .
young people often have difficulty reading anything written more than 50 years ago , making their past largely inaccessible to them .
but with my morality meter running on empty right now , i opted for an unusual profile of asa yoelson -lrb- a.k.a . al jolson -rrb- by actor stephen mo hanan .
a bizarre hollywood solution to that difficulty came about when jean harlow died of kidney failure during the making of the 1937 comedy `` saratoga . ''
