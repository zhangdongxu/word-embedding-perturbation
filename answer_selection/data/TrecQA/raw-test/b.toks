an estimated 50,000 americans practice wicca , a form of polytheistic nature worship .
the inch- thick chaplain handbook includes a five -page primer on wicca , described as `` a reconstruction of the nature worship of tribal europe . ''
wicca -- sometimes spelled wycca -- comes from the old english word for witch .
ms . siefferly , a senior at the high school , has practiced wicca for several years after reading a book on the subject , schram said .
that 's because ms . palmer is a witch , the high priestess of a group that practices wicca at fort hood with the knowledge and approval of the u.s . army .
such sentiments are rooted in fear and false notions that witches worship satan or sacrifice animals , said david oringderff , head of the san antonio -based pagan group that sponsors ms . palmer 's fort hood open circle .
`` if they deny our right to worship ...
wicca members tend to be white , college-educated , middle-class women , many of whom have families , said ms . berger , who said the religion was becoming more institutionalized as the members aged .
the fear of a backlash has never disappeared , said ms . berger , who added that the false stereotype that witches worship satan endures .
`` when people think of wicca , they think of either satanism or silly mumbo jumbo. ''
its followers describe wicca as a nature-based belief system that existed in europe before christianity .
even so , why are a growing number of scholars studying followers of the occult ?

amtrak has not turned a profit since it was founded in 1971 .
in 1971 , amtrak -- which combined and streamlined the operations of 18 intercity passenger railroads -- went into service .
amtrak has not made a profit since congress created it in 1971 to take over passenger operations of private railroads .
congress created amtrak in 1971 from a collection of failing passenger railroads .
the long-awaited new trains , whose secret name and other vital statistics were being released at a news conference today , will start running in october along tracks that amtrak currently uses .
amtrak views the northeast corridor as a model for other high-speed rail proposals in the great lakes , along the southeast and gulf coast and throughout california and the pacific northwest .
in 1997 , congress said amtrak must become self-sufficient by 2002 .
amtrak currently transports about 9 million people each year along the northeast corridor , some 7 million between new york and washington and an additional 2 million between new york and boston .
in recent years , amtrak has spent millions improving the track and adding electrical service from new haven to boston .
while not as fast as the 185-mph tgv , the new amtrak trains will glide around corners using technology that gently tilts the cars .
twenty years after the last passenger train left oklahoma , amtrak rolled back into the state on monday with daily service between oklahoma city and fort worth , texas .
the result is a collaborative effort between the state and amtrak , with oklahoma leasing the track , trains and crew and amtrak operating the train .
oklahoma 's venture with amtrak is n't unique .
only five states are without amtrak service -- alaska , hawaii , maine , wyoming and south dakota .

sen . john mccain panned a plan that would give amtrak a '' multibillion-dollar blank check '' even though the railway is under orders to become independent from federal operating subsidies .
the arizona republican , chairman of the senate commerce committee , led a highly critical oversight hearing tuesday that painted a sobering portrait of amtrak 's financial status and outlook .
'' amtrak is largely no better off today than one year ago , '' said phyllis scheinberg , associate director for transportation issues at the general accounting office .
both scheinberg and kenneth mead , inspector general in the department of transportation , said amtrak is not on track to meet congressional demands that it achieve financial self-sufficiency by 2003 .
amtrak could face liquidation if it fails to meet the deadline .
mead forecasts that amtrak will lose $ 1.4 billion more than it anticipates from 2000 through 2004 because rising costs are counteracting gains in riders and revenue .
it would let amtrak issue bonds , sweetened by federal tax credits , to raise $ 10 billion over 10 years to build high-speed rail lines around the country .
amtrak advocates say the money represents an investment in intercity rail that should be considered independent of amtrak 's future as a corporation .
'' amtrak needs to make more progress before any further funding schemes are enacted , '' he said .
tuesday 's hearing was a dramatic departure from the last time amtrak 's fate was considered by commerce committee members .
in february , a subcommittee led by amtrak supporter sen . kay bailey hutchison , r - texas , endorsed the railway 's plan to expand rather than cut service as the route to fiscal health .
but hutchison and pro- amtrak democrats max cleland of georgia and john kerry of massachusetts had to settle for supporting roles tuesday as mccain offered an unflattering history lesson about amtrak , which runs two routes that cross arizona .
the promise , mccain said , was that amtrak would be self-sufficient after two years of federal operating subsidies .
amtrak is now in its 29th year of subsidies and has consumed more than $ 23 billion in federal operating support .
'' i am now embarrassed to admit that i worked to create amtrak , '' joseph vranich , a former amtrak spokesman turned critic , told the committee .
congress gave amtrak in 1997 an infusion of aid along with a 2003 deadline to become self-sufficient .
amtrak chairman tommy thompson , wisconsin 's governor , told the committee the railway will meet the deadline .
he said amtrak 's governing board met last week and addressed much of the criticism in mead 's audit .
'' for much of amtrak 's history , it was not run like a business , '' thompson said .
'' it did not have an entrepreneurial focus .
it did lack a serious business plan .
but in recent years we have made remarkable progress in turning amtrak around. ''
thompson , mead and scheinberg agreed that , even if amtrak weans itself from federal operating subsidies by 2003 , it will need significant continuing federal support for capital expenses like track repair .
amtrak president george warrington told the committee that the railway expects delivery next week of the first of 20 high-speed trains for the boston -to- washington northeast corridor .

schulz said amtrak prepared for the new guarantee program by training its 25,000 employees '' to take personal initiative and do what is necessary to solve guest problems. ''
currently , about 24,000 employees work for amtrak , according to spokesman steven taubenkibel .
`` long-term success here has to do with doing it right , getting it right and increasing market share , '' said george warrington , amtrak 's president and chief executive .
`` we will treat our customers as valued guests ... , so they will choose to ride our trains over and over again , '' said george warrington , amtrak 's president and chief executive .

`` we are going to guarantee passenger rights while others in the transportation industry are fighting them in congress , '' said george warrington , amtrak 's president .
george warrington , amtrak 's president and chief executive , said the railroad would face a shortfall in the next fiscal year as a result of the delay .
george warrington , amtrak 's president , said ridership was up because service was better and because `` the marketplace is feeling increasingly frustrated with the alternatives , '' namely jammed highways and delayed airplanes .
amtrak is offering a deal it hopes few travelers can resist : get good service or a free ride .
amtrak , which must wean itself from federal operating subsidies by 2003 , hopes its planned service improvements -- such as flowers in bathrooms and entertainment for children -- will boost revenues by $ 85 million over three years .
central to winning customers ' confidence is amtrak 's new pledge : amtrak will offer dissatisfied passengers a refund voucher good for future travel .
amtrak spokesman john wolf estimated that only one out of every 1,000 passengers will request a refund voucher .
amtrak is offering vouchers , instead of refunds on the current trip , to give itself a second chance to woo the customer .
amtrak still faces hurdles , such as limited routes and schedules , in becoming a true alternative to airlines .
earlier this year , amtrak announced a high-speed service to lure travelers who now fly the lucrative washington - new york - boston shuttle route .
amtrak also is developing other high-speed rail corridors elsewhere , including one linking illinois , indiana , iowa , michigan , minnesota , missouri , nebraska , ohio , and wisconsin .
amtrak passenger revenues exceeded $ 1 billion for the first time ever last year , with 21 million customers riding by rail .
amtrak said it had the best on-time performance in 13 years .
moscow is insisting on a separate sector for its peacekeepers ; nato says that wo n't happen though president clinton predicted a `` successful conclusion. ''

amtrak , wooing people to take the train , not the plane , today promised all passengers good service or a voucher for a free ride .
amtrak has agreed to settle a race discrimination lawsuit filed by black management employees and applicants for management positions .
under terms of the settlement , amtrak did not admit to any wrongdoing , but agreed to extensive changes in corporate practices designed to prevent race discrimination .
michael lieder , lead counsel for the plaintiffs , said that the new practices `` will help employees of all races survive and thrive at amtrak well into the future. ''
in addition , amtrak has created a new position , vice president of business diversity and strategic initiatives , and filled the job .
the lawsuit , filed last august in the u.s . district court for the district of columbia , contended amtrak discriminated against blacks in filling management jobs and handling pay , promotion and disciplinary issues .
it also alleged amtrak maintained a racially hostile work environment .
for the second time in nine months , amtrak has settled a racial discrimination suit , the latest alleging the national railway condoned hostile work conditions for blacks that created a '' segregated work force . ''
amtrak did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement announced on friday , but the railway agreed to change company policies .
the suit was filed by 13 black members of the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees who build and maintain railroad tracks for amtrak 's engineering department in the northeast corridor between washington and boston .
'' there 's a lot that amtrak has agreed to here that would not have happened if this had gone into litigation , '' she said .
the agreement settles the first of three discrimination suits filed against amtrak in the past two years .
in july 1999 , amtrak settled a suit filed by black managers and employees seeking management positions .

washington _ amtrak managers filed a class-action lawsuit thursday alleging that the company discriminated against african-americans in management and other white-collar positions .
the lawsuit is the second discrimination charge against amtrak this year in us district court in washington .
black track-laying and repair workers in the northeast filed a class-action suit in april , also charging unfair treatment of blacks and likening amtrak to a `` plantation . ''
the plaintiffs ' lawyers said they want amtrak to change its employment and disciplinary practices , and they are seeking damages for back pay and mental anguish .
in response to the allegations , amtrak officials said thursday the company works to prevent discrimination .
`` amtrak has a zero -tolerance policy for discriminatory practices in hiring or in any aspect of the workplace , '' said george d . warrington , amtrak 's acting president and chief executive officer .
the earlier lawsuit , which included two amtrak workers from massachusetts , opened the door for the second suit , lawyers said .
the white female plaintiff , leslie dunning of fairfax station , va . , said amtrak demoted her in retaliation for helping a black manager prepare a report that detailed discrimination within the company .
in a conference call with reporters to discuss the company 's plans , warrington said that before congress created amtrak a quarter-century ago , nearly half of railroads ' passenger -train revenue actually came from hauling freight .
in adding freight cars now to its regular passenger runs , he said , amtrak will not allow any compromise in speed or reliability .
`` they 've already added so much time to the schedule of the chief , '' said ross capon , executive director of the national association of railroad passengers , `` and already had so many horror stories. ''
analysts said they thought amtrak could find a substantial niche in carrying high-value freight .
amtrak also said wednesday that it would close its food warehouses and hire dobbs international services , which already provides food to airlines , to do the same with trains .
new york _ aiming to bring high-speed rail service to boston by the start of the new millennium , amtrak said tuesday that it would start rolling out the first of its new 150 mile -an-hour trains by december .
but more important for amtrak , the high-speed train provides a model for its rail service across the nation , and is the centerpiece of its hopes of economic redemption after operating for three decades with government subsidies .
`` today we are kicking off the revitalization of train service in america , '' gov . tommy g . thompson of wisconsin , who is the chairman of amtrak 's board , said at a manhattan news conference .
with new , electrified engines pulling rebuilt amtrak cars , the three-hour schedule has been made possible by extensive track work and electrification from new haven to boston , a project that cost $ 1.6 billion .
officials of amtrak refused to say what they would charge for the high-speed rail trip .
amtrak 's ticket pricing for high-speed trains could be crucial to its success .
to attract more riders , amtrak said it would schedule more trains along the length of its northeast corridor , with the biggest service expansion between boston and new york city .
another question left unanswered tuesday was how many stops the high-speed trains would make , another complex equation for amtrak planners , since every stop increases travel time for those on board .
preliminary plans by amtrak that were released yesterday call for stops of its high-speed express service in boston , providence , r.i . ,
amtrak plans to name the trains acela -lrb- pronounced uh-sell-uh -rrb- , which is a made-up name , not an acronym .
david neeleman , the company 's chief executive , said recently that the airline will operate as jetblue airways .
amtrak is rolling out satisfaction express
amtrak plans to put a customer-satisfaction guarantee into effect by the end of the year .
amtrak said its new hiring would focus on people with traits that met customer-service needs .
trains that do n't pass muster wo n't be permitted to leave , said john wolf , an amtrak spokesman .
amtrak is counting on the new service , called acela , to lure business away from the airlines and to generate $ 180 million a year in profits .
but he said amtrak would make ends meet with new revenue , most of which is derived from one-time deals .
amtrak said it would know in 60 days when the trains would be ready .
warrington and the president of bombardier , jacques lapare , were not specific about the cause of the problem , but lapare said that it became apparent only because of instrumentation on a test train at pueblo .
amtrak is also upgrading the tracks between washington and boston , said warrington , which should lead to improved service even before the high-speed trains are introduced .
amtrak will lose money again this year , but will meet the congressional deadline of weaning itself from operating subsidies by the fiscal year ending sept . 30 , 2002 , officials said .
amtrak ridership statistics go back to 1975 .
when jack welch took over ge in 1981 , he inherited a slow-moving , bureaucratic company .
for that matter , the world wide web did not even exist when john f . welch jr . took over the general electric co . in 1981 .
welch became ge 's chief executive in april 1981 , so the date will mark his 20th anniversary .
welch has turned what had been a $ 25 billion manufacturing company in 1981 into a $ 100 billion behemoth that derives huge portions of its revenues from more profitable services .
when welch was named chief executive in 1981 , most of the also- rans quit .
in his author 's note , he points out that the subject of his book , jack welch , chairman of general electric co . , refused to cooperate with the project .
`` at any cost '' is actually a remarkably one-sided book about welch 's tenure at ge .
o'boyle has made welch the poster boy for modern capitalism and all the ills that accompany it : downsizing , deal-making , ethical violations , pollution .
if the book had come out a few months later , o'boyle probably would have blamed welch for the asian financial crisis and the collapse of the ruble .
welch rolled up his sleeves and went to work .
welch did n't invent the forces of modern capitalism .
bill gates may be america 's best known corporate leader , but in business circles , jack welch is probably more admired .
welch has created winners in at least half a dozen separate fields .
he dismisses welch 's foray into finance _ probably his greatest triumph _ in a few paragraphs .
o'boyle has plenty to say about the problems of the welch years .
more than 100,000 ge jobs have been axed under welch , in a series of downsizings that have devastated old industrial towns like pittsfield and schenectady , n.y . did welch need to be so hard-nosed ?
it is also fair to ask how much blame welch should bear for some of the ethical lapses that have happened on his watch , especially in the defense business .
while welch has never told his employees to break the law , the high-pressure culture he has created may have encouraged some of his underlings to cross the line in pursuit of greater profits .
in the business press , jack welch receives very different treatment .
someday , a book will come along that provides a balanced account of jack welch .
nor did anyone at the ltv corp . question peter e . kelly about the marketing potential of the internet when he was named president of the company in 1991 and became a front-runner for the top job .
`` even if they do n't specify internet savvy by name , they are asking for it , '' said gerard r . roche , chairman of heidrick & struggles , a search firm .
`` the internet is such a new phenomenon that it would be too limiting to mandate hands-on experience , '' said thomas j . neff , chairman of u.s . operations for the search firm spencer stuart .
that worries kelly , 57 , who became chairman of ltv in february .
everyone knew it was coming , but now they know when : john f . welch jr . , the chairman of general electric , will retire after the company 's annual meeting in april 2001 .
welch , who announced the date on cnbc on monday evening , will turn 65 on nov . 19 , 2000 , and had always indicated he would step down then .
`` jack still plans to announce his successor in mid-2000 , so this is business as usual for us , '' said beth comstock , a ge spokeswoman .
in a sense , welch will be both a difficult and an easy act to follow .
corporate wags have long referred to ge as `` the house that jack built. ''
he whittled away at ge 's bloated staff long before downsizing became a buzzword , earning him the rubric of neutron jack _ someone who kills off the people but leaves the physical assets intact .
welch has also turned ge into what he calls a `` boundary-less '' organization , a place where executives are rewarded for sharing insights and customer contacts and castigated for keeping good ideas to themselves .
only people whom welch deemed to be team players were propelled up the ranks .
`` the businesses have a momentum in market share and profitability that will persist when jack is retired , '' said russell a . leavitt , an analyst at banc of america securities .
`` and jack will personally introduce him to the major customers . ''
welch has often said he thinks chief executives should stay for 10 , even 20 years , to live with the results of their long-term decisions .
at 43 , immelt could conceivably serve as long as welch has .
`` six sigma has galvanized our company with an intensity the likes of which i have never seen in my 40 years at ge , '' said john welch , chairman of general electric .
so fervent a proselytizer is welch that ge has spent three years and more than $ 1 billion to convert all of its divisions to the six sigma faith .
the ge medical systems unit recently introduced a $ 1.25 million diagnostic scanner , the first product that ge designed from start to finish using six sigma principles .
six sigma teamwork enabled ge plastics to produce 1.1 billion pounds more plastics without building one new plant .
in the case of the new ge medical systems product _ a superfast diagnostic scanner called the lightspeed _ 200 people spent nearly three years and almost $ 50 million to run 250 separate six sigma analyses .
ge medical systems , which already controls 39 percent of the $ 1.6 billion global market for scanners , has high hopes for the lightspeed .
but six sigma enabled ge medical to anticipate which compromises doctors would accept .
the old tubes , which cost $ 59,000 each to replace , had long been a thorn in ge 's side .
ge-welch -lrb- undated -rrb- _ jack welch , chairman and chief executive of general electric , has set a date of april 2001 for his previously disclosed plans to step down .
ge-welch -lrb- undated -rrb- _ everyone knew it was coming , but now they know when : john welch , the chairman of general electric co . , will retire after the company 's annual meeting in april 2001 .
everyone knew it was coming , but now they know when : john f . welch jr . , the chairman of general electric , will retire after the company 's annual meeting in april 2001 .
ge 's welch plans to retire in april 2001
welch plans to retire in 2001 , and analysts who track the company have said the presidents of ge medical systems , ge power systems and ge aircraft engines are the apparent frontrunners for welch 's position .
ge - welch-role looking at welch 's role as a model for chief executives everywhere .
welch became ge 's chief executive in april 1981 , so the date will mark his 20th anniversary .
`` jack still plans to announce his successor in mid-2000 , so this is business as usual for us , '' said beth comstock , a ge spokeswoman .
corporate wags have long referred to ge as `` the house that jack built. ''
he whittled away at ge 's bloated staff long before downsizing became a buzzword , earning him the rubric of neutron jack _ someone who kills off the people but leaves the physical assets intact .
he divested all businesses in which ge was not dominant _ a strategy that has been adopted by numerous american companies .
he is pushing all of ge 's divisions into e-commerce with such fervor that many analysts say that ge will soon be the most internet-savvy of the non-dot- com companies .
welch has also turned ge into what he calls a `` boundary-less '' organization , a place where executives are rewarded for sharing insights and customer contacts and castigated for keeping good ideas to themselves .
`` he turned ge away from the idea of supreme rulers and introduced it to team structures , '' said nicholas p . heymann , an analyst with prudential securities .
but who , in fact , will be the next no . 1 at ge ?
gary m . reiner , 45 , ge 's chief information officer , has led many of the company 's initial forays onto the web .
david l . calhoun , 42 , the new head of ge capital , ge 's biggest and most profitable unit , is often cited as a dark horse candidate .
still , although no one will say so for the record , the odds-on favorite is jeffrey r . immelt , head of ge medical systems .
he was the first ge executive to use six sigma not only to refine processes but to design a product .
shares of ge have ridden a roller coaster over the last week .
ge fell 93.75 cents tuesday , to $ 128.4375 .
`` a strong quarter is business as usual for ge , but this quarter was even better than normal , '' said charles hill , director of research at first call .
investors seemed unimpressed as shares of ge , based in fairfield , conn . , fell $ 1 , to $ 52.50 .
`` most industrial companies are experiencing no more than 5 percent organic growth , so ge 's results are just phenomenal , '' said jeffrey sprague , an analyst at salomon smith barney .
the numbers did little to help handicap the race to succeed jack welch , the ge chairman , who will retire next year .
ge power systems had a particularly robust quarter , with sales up 60 percent .
all makers of turbines had growth spurts as utilities continued their buying spree , but analysts say that ge grabbed share away from competitors like abb and siemens .
ge medical nearly doubled its sales of x-ray machines , while sales of cat scanners and ultrasound machines were up more than 35 percent .
thanks to robust sales of high-margin services , ge aircraft engines saw its profit rise 20 percent on a revenue increase of just 4 percent .
even without new reality or game shows , ge 's television network , nbc , held onto a high share of viewers aged 18 to 49 _ the ones advertisers pay most to reach .
earnings at ge capital , meanwhile , were up 17 percent on a revenue rise of 23 percent .
analysts expect those earnings to rise even higher as ge capital continues to de-emphasize businesses like the leasing of rail cars in favor of those featuring financial services .
ge , never short of cash , will soon have even more .
ge owns part of painewebber and should reap $ 1.4 billion from the deal .
gary sheffer , a ge spokesman , insists that ge was not consulted on the merger and has not yet made plans for the money .
ge , in fact , bought back $ 523 million in stock during the quarter .
wright , 57 , will continue at nbc 's helm , a seat he has occupied for nearly 14 years , and will be responsible for overseeing ge 's media interest in his new role , the company said .
`` bob 's a visionary with a great strategic mind , and he 's a strong business leader with outstanding people skills , '' ge chairman and chief executive jack welch said in a statement .
in the future , analyst lawrence horan said , nbc could play an increasingly vital role as ge puts an added emphasis on the communications and information fields .
ge 's decision to broaden wright 's influence , he added , reflects that commitment .
shares of ge were down 1 3/8 , or 3 percent , to 51 1/8 in afternoon trading .
more than 100,000 ge jobs have been axed under welch , in a series of downsizings that have devastated old industrial towns like pittsfield and schenectady , n.y . did welch need to be so hard-nosed ?
along the way he sold off underperforming divisions and fired about 100,000 people , thus earning himself the name `` neutron jack . ''
`` at any cost '' is actually a remarkably one-sided book about welch 's tenure at ge .
when jack welch took over ge in 1981 , he inherited a slow-moving , bureaucratic company .
at the same time he moved ge into service businesses like entertainment and finance that promised greater growth and higher returns .
welch did n't invent the forces of modern capitalism .
between 1982 and 1997 ge 's stock price rose 1,155 percent .
he calls the failure of a new ge refrigerator in the 1980s `` one of the greatest fiascoes in modern engineering. ''
the author spends a full 50 pages describing the government 's attempt to prosecute ge for price fixing in the industrial diamond business .
could the transformation of ge have been accomplished in a more humane way ?
in his 20 years as ge 's chief executive officer , welch has generated enormous wealth not only for the company 's stockholders but for hundreds of companies that do business with ge .
people are not going to buy it for its plot , character development or sex appeal .
unlike chrysler 's lee iacocca , whose story sold an astonishing 2.6 million hardcover books , welch did not rescue a large american company from bankruptcy , nor does he have iacocca 's promotional flair .
people will buy welch 's book because it will be marketed as the definitive text of modern american business practices .
but a lot of people think he has all the answers , and time warner is betting that that there are at least 1.6 million people willing to pay good money to find out what they are .
ge was famous for , even admired for its layers of sector managers , department managers , unit managers and supervisors , all of whom were thought to be essential to strategic planning and quality control .
freed of fuzzy paternalism , the people who remained were encouraged to think for themselves and question the corporate culture , resulting not only in technological innovation but in huge cost savings .

he was the titular head of the khmer rouge guerrillas during the civil war from 1970 to 1975 , and then was briefly head of state of cambodia during the khmer rouge period .
three international jurists hired by the united nations are in cambodia , looking at the evidence against the most important khmer rouge leaders and assessing the feasibility of trials .
new york _ after months of wavering , cambodia friday officially rejected u.n . recommendations to convene a tribunal to try surviving senior khmer rouge leaders , seeming to kill any chance of an international court .
hor nam hong , cambodia 's foreign minister , flew to new york and informed u.n . secretary general kofi annan that cambodia would hold a trial of khmer rouge leaders in its own courts .
the cambodian trial would cover the period from 1975 to 1979 when the khmer rouge governed cambodia , taking the lives of 2 million cambodians .
but hor nam hong said friday that with the help of international jurists , cambodia could try the khmer rouge in the country where `` we were all their victims . ''
khmer rouge rule in cambodia was one of the modern world 's most brutal regimes .
ieng sary with several thousand khmer rouge forces broke away from the guerrilla movement and crossed over to the government of cambodia in august last year .
phnom penh , december 26 -lrb- xinhua -rrb- -- cambodia 's top khmer rouge political leader khieu samphan has surrendered to the government , a local radio reported saturday .
in his letter , hun sen reiterated that `` we have never rejected the accountability of the khmer rouge leaders for the crimes of genocide in cambodia . ''
the u.n . experts came to cambodia last november to investigate the khmer rouge issues and made the report to kofi annan .
cambodia objected to a foreign panel of judges , arguing that this kind of tribunal would violate the country 's sovereign powers , and the national parliament effectively vetoed the idea .
ieng sary , who did not take sides in cambodia 's recent political turmoil , arrived here on tuesday for the first time since the khmer rouge was driven from power by a vietnamese invasion in early 1979 .
cambodian leader hun sen says that upcoming elections will be more peaceful than polls in 1993 monitored by the united nations , thanks largely to the collapse of the khmer rouge .
hun sen said that the government will place 70,000 soldiers and civilians at the disposal of the national electoral commission , the body overseeing the polls , to ensure a stable election environment .
the cambodian government 's decision to welcome back into the fold five important leaders of the dying khmer rouge rebel movement smacked of hypocrisy , ousted co- premier prince norodom ranariddh said saturday .
but his actions were not treated as a victory heralding the end of the guerrilla movement , as hun sen 's recently have been .
a trio of veteran rebel leaders , including khieu samphan , still remains in the jungle , along with perhaps several hundred followers while smaller bands of khmer rouge roam remote areas of the country .
any trial of surviving khmer rouge leaders implicated in genocide and other crimes against humanity should take place on cambodian soil , prime minister hun sen said in an interview published thursday .
doubtful that khmer rouge military chief ta mok and other surviving rebels could be apprehended , the prime minister suggested a cambodian trial instead .
the rebel 's historically close relationship with the thai military and the reintegration of several top khmer rouge _ also possible defendants _ into the cambodian government are seen as a potential stumbling blocks to a trial .
ieng sary , a deputy prime minister in the khmer rouge regime , received an amnesty from the government in 1996 in exchange for leading a mass defection of rebel fighters that crippled the movement .
earlier today , cambodian prime minister hun sen said khieu samphan and nuon chea , members of khmer rouge leader pol pot 's inner circle during the group 's brutal 1975-79 rule , must be tried for genocide .
fernando henrique cardoso became brazil 's first re-elected president today , vowing to continue modernizing the economy while battling the country 's deep social inequality .
he is the first brazilian president to take advantage of a 1997 constitutional change allowing the head of state to serve a second term .
leader confident on khmer rouge case
in addition to the political cross-currents that complicate a resolution to the country 's past conflicts , there is a network of often-hidden personal relationships that keeps past debts and rivalries alive .
among these are khieu samphan , the movement 's nominal head of state , and nuon chea , a top ideologist , who both surrendered to the government on dec . 25 .
the vietnamese discovered the archival records of the khmer rouge bureaucracy that disclosed the systematic torture and killing of cambodians as well as the killing fields that held the remains of the victims .
along with pol pot , they oversaw the khmer rouge and their reign of terror , during which at least 1 million cambodians are estimated to have been executed or to have died of starvation , disease and overwork .
the king , who has close ties to the chinese government and is undergoing medical treatment in beijing , headed the country for more than two decades .
in the past the cambodian leader , hun sen , has favored prosecuting khmer rouge leaders , whose regime in the late 1970s killed more than 1 million people .
the minister also announced that his government has rejected the recommendation that a truth commission be convened to try lesser figures in the khmer rouge movement .
nuon chea , his second-in-command , surrendered in december with a fellow khmer rouge leader , khieu samphan , to the cambodian government .
in his 1997 letter requesting the aid of the united nations in setting up a tribunal , hun sen said his country did not have the `` resources or the expertise '' to conduct a trial .
a number of former khmer rouge officials from the movement that devastated the country from 1975 to early 1979 are now in government or other influential positions .
phnom penh , october 29 -lrb- xinhua -rrb- -- cambodian second prime minister hun sen held talks earlier today with former khmer rouge leader ieng sary , but the details of the talks were not disclosed .

ieng sary , for his part , has described how the guerrillas used an alliance with sihanouk to help win power , once likening him to a `` water buffalo who will help us cross the river. ''
at least 14 of the king 's relatives and children died under khmer rouge rule .
it was a political deal undertaken to ensure the eventual defection of some 10,000 war-weary khmer rouge guerrillas to the government .
the defections marked the beginning of the end for the khmer rouge , which is now down to a few hundred guerrillas along the thai border .
his death has spurred new calls by human-rights groups and some western governments , led by the united states , for the trial of remaining khmer rouge leaders .
sihanouk was toppled by a u.s . -backed coup in 1970 and lent his support to the khmer rouge , then a small band of jungle guerrillas , against the new government .
the khmer rouge regime , however , proved every bit as rabidly anti-vietnamese as lon nol , and their old allies responded to repeated border attacks by toppling the khmer rouge in 1979 .
hun sen , a mid-ranking khmer rouge commander who defected to escape purges , rose to the top of the hanoi -installed government in 1985 and has been cambodia 's most powerful figure ever since .
the irony is that he was a leading member of the ousted khmer rouge , which did n't permit free elections during its five-year reign of terror .
chan youran served as the khmer rouge ambassador to many countries , including china , where the creed of cultural revolution originated .
as many as 2 million cambodians were executed or died from starvation , forced labor and illness before a vietnamese invasion toppled the khmer rouge in 1979 .
their defections came after the khmer rouge stronghold in anlong veng was overrun by government troops in april and they advocated ending the war .
the defectors were greeted with open arms by the government of strongman hun sen , who has spent years denouncing the khmer rouge but found that the best way of beating them was to let them join .
`` we are happy to take part in the elections , '' said kor bun heng , the former senior spokesman for the khmer rouge .

the last main fighting force of the khmer rouge , the radical marxist guerrillas who killed nearly two million cambodians , have surrendered to the government , a journalist close to the rebels said on saturday .
in 1997 , thayer became the first journalist allowed to interview the khmer rouge 's late leader pol pot , who had not been seen in public in nearly two decades , and who died in april this year .
the surrender of the khmer rouge would bring to an end more than 30 years of civil war in cambodia that began with the marxist guerrilla 's insurgency against the government in phnom penh in the late 1960s .
they apparently no longer command any troops , but their former followers did not want to give them up .

bott 's work with quarks , an elementary particle found in protons and neutrons , has contributed to the string theory , the so-called `` theory of everything '' to explain the universe .
in those first instants , scientists believe , subatomic particles called quarks and gluons roamed freely , rather than being locked inside the protons and neutrons that make up atomic nuclei , as they seem to be now .
its crucial component is the `` strange quark '' - one of six types of quarks , which are the tiniest building blocks of matter .
the other is quantum mechanics , which describes the unseen universe of subatomic particles _ electrons , quarks and , perhaps , elements yet unknown .
so `` strange stars ' would offer scientists their only chance to observe a large and stable piece of quark matter , the report added .
though the $ 600 million collider opened about a year ago at the lab in upton , n.y . , the achievement of the first particle collisions was delayed by technical problems .
but quarks rarely exist as separate entities , and it 's possible to get only a brief glimpse of their existence in high-energy particle accelerators .
washington , july 21 -lrb- xinhua -rrb- -- scientists friday hailed the finding of first direct evidence of the existence of tau neutrino as a milestone in particle physics .
physicist wolfgang pauli first proposed in 1930 the existence of a neutral particle , later named `` neutrino , '' for `` little neutral one , '' by enrico fermi .

characterizing the quarks cleared the way for quantum chromodynamics -lrb- qcd -rrb- , the field theory describing the strong force binding particles together in the atom 's nucleus .
it 's probably ok to call a proton a `` beanbag '' containing three quarks , but to call a proton accelerator an `` atom smasher '' makes physicists squirm .
their equations were vital in calculating the mass of the top quark , which was observed for the first time in 1995 at the fermilab in the united states .

the museum is named for world war ii pacific fleet commander and fredericksburg native admiral chester nimitz , under whom bush served .
his family history , plus the nimitz museum 's emphasis on world war ii 's pacific battles , fed schroeder 's interest in the island-hopping campaign .
indeed , the ancestors of chester w . nimitz , the u.s . naval commander in chief of the pacific in world war ii , were among the first german pioneers to settle the area .
since the museum opened in 1983 , fredericksburg has become a haven for retired military servicemen who come to trace nimitz 's career and the events of world war ii .
slew mccain 's peers at the naval academy were chester nimitz and william `` bull '' halsey , who would become major commanders during world war ii .
yuengling served as a staff sergeant with the u.s . army air corps during world war ii .
in world war ii , bryer was a captain and battalion surgeon in the seventh armored division in europe , and he received a bronze star and a silver star .
the memories were n't all pleasant for george bush as he toured a new museum gallery dedicated to world war ii battles in the pacific .
schroeder and 35 members of his world war ii re-enactment group spread out across the state when the spielberg movie opened last month .
they sent men dressed in world war ii uniforms to theaters in san antonio , austin and houston .
it shows that world war ii brought us into the nuclear age , schroeder says .
more than 65 world war ii vehicles were used in the parade .
`` schools might have two days to teach world war ii history .
there was his grandfather , admiral john `` slew '' mccain , class of 1906 , a grizzled old sea dog who commanded aircraft carriers in the pacific during world war ii .
also , the strain of operations in world war ii was immense. ''
after the war , bryer returned to his alma mater , johns hopkins university , where he and a team of researchers developed aureomycin , tetracycline , polymyxin agents and other antibiotics .
he joined the chicago daily news as a reporter after the war , later becoming city editor and assistant managing editor .
`` i saw the island over which my roommate was shot down , the first casualty of our squadron , '' said the former president , who served as a young pilot during the war .
bush cut the ribbon friday on the george bush gallery of the national museum of the pacific war , part of the larger admiral nimitz museum and historical center .
a group in the dallas-fort worth area did the same .
`` most groups do indian wars , the civil war ; not many people do anything from the 20th century . ''
it took until 1994 to come up with a base plan on how to teach world war ii. ''
last year , he engineered a marine landing on galveston island ; in 1995 he put together a `` welcome home parade '' for veterans of the war in the pacific .
`` that 's something they never got after the war , '' he said .
schroeder insists that he and his re-enactors are not trying to romanticize war .
with children , he explained , they do n't even talk about war .
the latest addition to the park , the $ 3 million national museum of the pacific war and george bush gallery , is scheduled to open to the public june 12 .
`` what did you say ? ''
according to his grandson , mccain was the quintessential combat officer _ a throwback , a gregarious , beloved commander who did n't worry whether his uniform was pressed .
but the war , and his lifestyle , taxed his health .
`` he smoked and he drank and he did n't take care of himself .
bill mccain , who graduated from west point , chased pancho villa with gen . blackjack pershing , served as an artillery officer during world war i and attained the rank of brigadier general .
after the family moved to mississippi , a number of mccain 's ancestors fought in the civil war on the side of the confederacy .
at episcopal high , a private boarding school in alexandria , va . , mccain was a rebel , earning the nickname `` mcnasty '' from classmates who did n't dare cross him .
he did just enough to pass the classes he did n't find stimulating .
`` did you have fun with her ?
dewey did not oppose new deal programs , which caused republicans to grouse about `` me-tooism , '' but which also made him a formidable candidate .
as the war and homefront rationing dragged on , he abandoned his nonpolitical strategy and spoke on sept . 23 to a friendly audience , the teamsters union , and to voters via radio .
hooting and hollering , banging the tables , the teamsters wanted more , as did millions at home .
bush cut the ribbon friday on the george bush gallery of the national museum of the pacific war , part of the larger admiral nimitz museum and historical center .
the museum is named for world war ii pacific fleet commander and fredericksburg native admiral chester nimitz , under whom bush served .
to commemorate nimitz ' illustrious career , his grandfather 's nimitz steamboat hotel at main and washington streets was turned into the admiral nimitz museum and historical center , a state historical park managed by texas parks and wildlife .
it is part of the admiral nimitz historical center in fredericksburg and is under the texas parks and wildlife department .
at the far end is the serene japanese garden of peace , a gift from the people of japan to symbolize the friendship between nimitz and their national hero adm . heihachiro togo .
the two did n't get a chance to meet .
bush explains that he served under adm . chester nimitz , the fredericksburg native for whom the complex is named .
the primary purpose , she said , is to reach a younger audience and give them a better understanding of the contributions that were made by the generation of world war ii .
for much of the 1920s , teapot dome _ a classic tale of oil tycoons , $ 100 bills and a jailed cabinet member _ was the talk of the nation .
it was the first trial of former cabinet officials since the teapot dome scandal in the 1920s , and it was the first time in the country 's history that two former cabinet officials were tried together .
in 1923 , as the tawdriness of the teapot dome scandal began to leak out , harding lamented , `` my god , this is a hell of a job .
last fall , congress decreed he will be the last in a long line of naval officers who have kept an eye on the oil field since a scandal rocked president warren harding 's administration in 1922 .
by the time harding died on aug . 2 , 1923 , apparently of a heart attack , the whistle was blowing on teapot .
tunison , a petroleum engineer , keeps watch over naval petroleum reserve no . 3 , better known as teapot dome .
at about the same time , department of energy officials hope to submit legislation to sell teapot dome to a private company or a group that would open it to drilling research .
in 1981 , production at teapot dome peaked at 5,000 barrels a day .
time has even taken its toll on a nearby rock formation that looked like a teapot to early prospectors .
a 1962 windstorm broke off the teapot 's spout .
but the dome , underground layers of rock shaped liked an upside-down bowl , is better known for its place in history than its oil .
the navy never used teapot dome 's oil directly .
sinclair oil co . , with the green dinosaur logo on gas station signs , remains the biggest buyer of teapot dome oil .
after the scandal , the navy retook control of the field and most of its oil was undisturbed until the late 1970s .
with oil prices hovering between dlrs 14 and dlrs 15 a barrel , the prospect of finding a buyer for teapot dome may not be good .
it does n't come all wrapped up in a neat little package in some cases , but the advent of scandal and stock market sinking spells are in close enough proximity to challenge your belief in coincidences .
from the time of the nixon -era watergate scandal marked by the `` saturday night massacre '' in october 1973 , the dow lost 40 percent during an ensuing 12-month bear debacle .
the teapot dome scandal broke during the calvin coolidge presidency but was a creature of the warren g . harding administration .
before that bit of unpleasantness you have to go back 50 more years to the grant regime , which saw four cabinet officers involved in scandal .
but the scandal that really smeared the memory of president warren harding bubbled 75 years ago from teapot dome , a vast pool of oil below treeless sagebrush flats just south of here .
the starr report could dethrone the teapot dome .
`` the scandal today is n't nothing compared to teapot dome , '' pauline schultz insisted , at her local history museum .
showing visitors around today , she lectured insistently : `` the teapot dome scandal was the largest in the united states .
at the town offices next door , melvin dimick , a plumber who doubles as mayor , defended teapot 's primacy , saying : `` it 's right up there at the top .
that was one big financial scandal .
but , even before monica lewinsky came along , time had not been kind to the teapot dome .
wyoming 's famous winds battered the signature landmark , a beige sandstone formation named teapot rock by passing cowboys .
the decline of the teapot dome field is part of a wider oil implosion in wyoming , a state heavily dependent on energy royalties to pave highways and pay for schools .
but , about 10 miles south of salt creek lay teapot dome , an untapped reserve on federal land that was off limits to private companies .
in april 1921 , only days after harding 's inauguration , harry sinclair , owner of sinclair oil co . , privately negotiated a lease on the teapot dome with the new interior secretary , albert fall .
`` for the general public , the revelation of a mistress and an illegitimate child was easier to grasp than the teapot dome . ''
but , here the consequence of teapot dome was as easy to grasp .
`` the scandal was so great , they had to wipe teapot dome off the map , '' mrs . schultz said of the navy 's decision to shut the oil field .
without the oil field , the town of teapot dome vanished , leaving only a few foundations visible today .
following a rootless pattern of human habitation that has marked much of wyoming in the 20th century , residents of teapot simply moved their houses down the road , heading to the next boom town .
the federal government , in fact , wants to sell teapot dome .
the mitchell-stans trial was the first trial of defendants who had been high-ranking nixon administration officials who had at least a tenuous link with the watergate scandal .
richard nixon likewise is seen only as the president who was forced from office by the watergate scandal , not as the outstanding foreign policy architect among the presidents of the second half of the 20th century .
because of the monica lewinsky scandal , bill clinton faces a similar assessment despite the good he has done in guiding the nation 's prosperity , aiding education and trying to settle longstanding foreign disputes .
looking over the current crop of presidential hopefuls , we should try to determine which candidate can best provide valorous , enlightened leadership in time of crisis , as did the giants of the past .
last fall , congress decreed he will be the last in a long line of naval officers who have kept an eye on the oil field since a scandal rocked president warren harding 's administration in 1922 .
but the scandal that really smeared the memory of president warren harding bubbled 75 years ago from teapot dome , a vast pool of oil below treeless sagebrush flats just south of here .
after harding 's death in 1923 , his vice president , calvin coolidge , succeeded him and restored respectability to a white house blackened by teapot dome and other scandals .
incidents such as the teapot dome scandal so marred warren g . harding 's presidency that historians consider him among the worst presidents in the nation 's history .
it took in the disapproving -lrb- -lrb- herbert j . -rrb- -rrb- hoover -lrb- -lrb- harding 's commerce secretary and later president -rrb- -rrb- , who always thought he would have made a better president than harding .
i remember , and i know , and i also know that no strange woman ever came here to see president warren g . harding . '
`` it was president harding , cabinet secretaries , there were many , many dignitaries involved. ''
harding was succeeded by coolidge , who spent much of his five-year presidency napping in the white house while business and industrial leaders pretty much ran the country .
the government took control in 1915 when president woodrow wilson set it aside in case the navy needed oil for battleships , destroyers and other warships as world war i approached .
the monica lewinsky sex scandal will leave a lasting impression on president clinton 's long-term reputation and may overshadow the accomplishments of his administration , two houston scholars said monday .
the president best known for his sexual escapades , however , was john f . kennedy , who was rumored to have had countless affairs , including one with star marilyn monroe .
in the past , brace said presidents were able to control what journalists wrote about them because washington press corps careers were based on access to the president .
it 's maybe not going too far out on a limb to say that president clinton is worried about his legacy nowadays .
`` in 1926 , a novel , ` revelry , ' describes a guilty president who poisons himself to escape scandals and exposure .
the first president to discuss civil rights in the south so frankly , he was loudly cheered by blacks and met with silent stares from whites .
the 55-year-old president had intimate encounters with a 24-year-old campaign volunteer in a cloak closet off the oval office in the white house .
showing visitors around today , she lectured insistently : `` the teapot dome scandal was the largest in the united states .
in 1915 , with world war i raging in europe , president woodrow wilson reserved this field and others in the west to create a secure supply for oil -burning navy ships .

rosenthal comments on president clinton 's problems .
washington _ president clinton 's admitted immoral behavior has thrust to the forefront a fundamental question about the meaning of the american presidency : should the president be a moral leader ?
`` in an ideal world , the president would be the paragon of virtue , '' said former new york gov . mario cuomo , a democrat .
`` there was a time when people expected presidents to be superman , '' said mansfield , who is 95 .
no president is on the pedestal any more. ''
henry graff , a professor emeritus of history at columbia university , said `` the wheel of history has to turn fortuitously '' for a president to have the opportunity to exhibit moral leadership .
herbert hoover , for example , was so scrupulously honest that he did not collect his salary as president .
one of the few presidents who is widely regarded as a true moral leader during a time of peace was theodore roosevelt , who from his `` bully pulpit '' preached again and again about honesty in government .
for all the talk of integrity , some people may not be more comfortable with a president who commands the same personal respect as , say , a member of the clergy .
a common perception is that politicians who are too clean may find it too distasteful to do some of the unsavory things that a president must do , like outmaneuver political opponents .
no one ever questioned the uprightness of president gerald r . ford or his successor , jimmy carter , who in the 1976 campaign presented himself as an antidote to the dishonesty of government in the watergate era .
but that did not prevent jackson from earning a place in history as a respectable president symbolizing abiding national values .
nixon , of course , became the first president to be forced from office because of ethical misdeeds , although many people still insist that he was an effective leader , particularly in foreign policy .
and truman was not particularly popular when he was president ; only recently have historians portrayed him as a heroic figure .
the most blatant distinction between a president 's personal morals and public values was drawn by democratic national committee national chairman steve grossman speaking , as clinton looked on , at a recent fund-raising event in new york .
former vice president dan quayle , who is considering a run for the white house in 2000 , volunteered on national tv recently that he had not had an extramarital affair .
when carter ran for president , he did not repudiate nixon and ford as much as he tried to promote the general healing of the nation .
the united states fared better in the 20th century .
then came herbert hoover , a talented engineer , who probably would have been an outstanding president had the great depression not come crashing down on him and the nation .
richard nixon likewise is seen only as the president who was forced from office by the watergate scandal , not as the outstanding foreign policy architect among the presidents of the second half of the 20th century .

charlestown navy yard , uss constitution museum , building 22 in the charlestown navy yard , off chelsea street .
everything in the museum is related to the constitution , docked at pier 1 in the navy yard .
although it 's still a commissioned warship -lrb- with a crew of 71 officers and seamen -rrb- , the constitution is more of a museum than anything else these days .
the constitution also offers a pretty good place to survey the boston skyline .

sacajawea was a shoshone girl who had been kidnapped by hidatsa indians .
but sacajawea recognized their chief , cameahwait , as her long lost brother , and another shoshone , jumping fish , as a girl she had not seen since the kidnapping .
the 400 or so lemhi live on a reservation 200 miles south of here , on desert land set aside for two much bigger tribes .
their affairs are handled by the much larger shoshone - bannock tribes on the reservation at fort hall , idaho .
lewis was counting on sacajawea to be a translator with shoshone people who lived in the mountains west of the continental divide , and he expressed concern that her death could doom the expedition .
with sacajawea 's help , they crossed the continental divide at lemhi pass , then came upon a band of shoshone .
also , as other historians have noted , svingen said , the lemhi were told they would lose their food rations if they did not agree to leave the valley .
the odds of the lemhi being restored as a tribe in the valley where they used to live are certainly long .
the shoshone-bannock say the lemhi belong with them at fort hall .
congress has been asked by idaho elected officials to consider plans for a sacajawea center here at salmon , but not one that would be run by the lemhi .
today , the salmon savages remain , while ariwite , 45 , and the rest of the lemhi shoshone tribe are gone .
and it is here , today , that ariwite is working as a shoshone moses , trying to bring his people home in what many view as a quixotic attempt at restoring a tribe .
svingen is writing a book about the lemhi and helping them seek federal restoration as a tribe .
the lemhi have been `` hostages '' of the sho-bans , he said , the foster children on a reservation where they never felt they belonged .
the shoshone-bannock tribe is composed of bands the lemhi often fought .
is soliciting votes and suggestions for the image of sacajawea that will adorn a gold-colored dollar coin to be issued in 2000 .
in fact , it seems to most closely resemble a tribe in japan .
pakistan-mood -lrb- rawalpindi , pakistan -rrb- _ in the bazaars of rawalpindi , life goes on as it did before pakistan was plunged into a state of emergency by its new military ruler .
but the tribe 's luck may be about to change .
`` the feeling we get is , `we do n't want you here , but we want your sacajawea heritage. '' '
she became one of two young wives of toussaint charbonneau , a french - canadian trader who won sacajawea in a bet with the indians .
when charbonneau signed on with lewis and clark , sacajawea , though just 15 years old and six months pregnant , was enlisted as an interpreter .
for her services on the expedition , sacajawea was given nothing , though her husband , charbonneau , received $ 500 .
`` their treaty was never ratified , so basically they belong down here , '' said duane thompson , chairman of the shoshone-bannock council , which governs the reservation .
and as soon as he did , he was attacked by texas gov . george w . bush , the republican front-runner considered most liable to damage should buchanan generate a serious tri-corner competition .
ariwite said he will appeal this year to president clinton for restoration of the lemhis as a tribe with treaty rights , while plying other federal agencies for land grants and money to purchase private land .
the lemhis are not a federally recognized tribe ; instead , they are considered part of the shoshone-bannock tribe on the fort hall reservation , located 243 miles east of boise .
within three years , the tribe sent the mormons scurrying back to utah , but it was a short-lived reprieve .
there , they moved in with tribes of shoshone-bannock .
leroy boyer , shoshone-bannock tribal council chief , did not return phone calls .
the coin honors the young woman and teen-age mother who accompanied explorers meriwether lewis and william clark to the pacific ocean in 1805 .
in 1804 , toussaint was hired by lewis and clark , not for his own skills but for those of sacagawea .
she knew several indian languages , and being shoshone could help the explorers make contact with her people and acquire horses that were crucial to the expedition .
little is documented about what happened to sacagawea after the expedition , but she is believed to have died dec . 20 , 1812 .
a : yes , but many years after the fact .
a month later , a japanese envoy made what was believed to be the first official apology on american soil for the attack 50 years earlier .
q : nearly 20 years ago , a nuclear reactor failed at the three mile island power plant in pennsylvania , creating a crisis .
the transaction , the first sale of a nuclear plant by a u.s . utility , is expected to take one to two years to win approval from regulators , including the nrc .
but that tumbledown village was destroyed by the local authorities more than 10 years ago .
the lewis and clark bicentennial is going to be our last fight .
when charbonneau signed on with lewis and clark , sacajawea , though just 15 years old and six months pregnant , was enlisted as an interpreter .
lewis was counting on sacajawea to be a translator with shoshone people who lived in the mountains west of the continental divide , and he expressed concern that her death could doom the expedition .
for her services on the expedition , sacajawea was given nothing , though her husband , charbonneau , received $ 500 .
her son , jean-baptist , was later raised in part by william clark .
also , as other historians have noted , svingen said , the lemhi were told they would lose their food rations if they did not agree to leave the valley .
the lewis and clark bicentennial is our last fight .
she is buried in wyoming .
but as soon as you 're accustomed to the new bill , expect more change : a new dollar coin to replace the infamous susan b . anthony .
a congress -appointed committee met monday and tuesday in philadelphia , and after much polite debate , decided which famous female will adorn the new dollar coin .
i had to aim the dish at exactly this spot , using the compass that comes with the kit , which is about the size of the sacajawea dollar _ but far less valuable .
the fort worth star-telegram plans to move the following stories for clients of the nytimes news service for ams and pms of thursday , june 11 , and thereafter .
fort worth , texas _ texas republicans are moving forward with a proposal to penalize gop candidates who do n't support abolishing partial birth abortion .
sacajawea .
the texas auto dealers association filed suit in fort worth today , seeking an injunction .
that 's what the advance pr says , anyway , as republicans from all over texas gather in fort worth this week for their state convention .
`` the feeling we get is , `we do n't want you here , but we want your sacajawea heritage. '' '
sacajawea was a shoshone girl who had been kidnapped by hidatsa indians .
she became one of two young wives of toussaint charbonneau , a french - canadian trader who won sacajawea in a bet with the indians .
when charbonneau signed on with lewis and clark , sacajawea , though just 15 years old and six months pregnant , was enlisted as an interpreter .
lewis was counting on sacajawea to be a translator with shoshone people who lived in the mountains west of the continental divide , and he expressed concern that her death could doom the expedition .
with sacajawea 's help , they crossed the continental divide at lemhi pass , then came upon a band of shoshone .
but sacajawea recognized their chief , cameahwait , as her long lost brother , and another shoshone , jumping fish , as a girl she had not seen since the kidnapping .
for her services on the expedition , sacajawea was given nothing , though her husband , charbonneau , received $ 500 .
congress has been asked by idaho elected officials to consider plans for a sacajawea center here at salmon , but not one that would be run by the lemhi .
so you may be wondering , then , was it worth it ?

in 1997 , the bodies of 39 members of the heaven 's gate techno-religious cult who 'd committed suicide were found inside a mansion in rancho santa fe , calif .
the items were the last earthly possessions of the 39 members of the heaven 's gate cult who killed themselves nearly three years ago in hopes of boarding a spaceship that they believed was trailing the hale-bopp comet .
late last month , more than 350 people turned out in san diego to bid for the possessions of the members of the heaven 's gate cult whose 39 in-house fanatics did away with themselves in a mass suicide .

the near certainty of bashar assad 's succession of his father , president hafez assad , gets a fresh boost saturday when syria 's ruling baath party meets to elect him party leader and declare his candidacy for president .
syria 's ruling baath party opened its first conference in 15 years saturday to elect bashar assad party leader and declare his candidacy for president , putting him closer to succeeding his father , the late president hafez assad .
bashar assad is a baath party member -- one of an estimated 1.5 million -- but until now has not held any formal position in the party .
on saturday , syria 's ruling baath party opened its first conference in 15 years to elect bashar assad party leader and declare his candidacy for president , putting him closer to succeeding his father .
syria 's ruling baath party nominated bashar assad for president on tuesday , making it virtually certain he will succeed his late father as leader of the country .
addressing the closing session of the party 's congress , bashar assad vowed that baath would remain faithful to the principles laid down by his father , president hafez assad .
bashar assad rejected suggestions that the baath party , which has monopolized power since 1963 , was becoming antiquated .
the ruling baath party elected bashar assad to the post of secretary general of its executive on saturday -- bringing the 34-year-old another step closer to taking over the presidency left vacant by his father 's death .
since the june 10 death of his father , president hafez assad , the parliament , the baath party and state-controlled media have been promoting bashar assad as syria 's next leader .
the state television also said that the leadership of the ruling baath party had voted unanimously to nominate bashar assad for the presidency .
at the baath party conference , expected to last up to five days , about 1,000 delegates are to elect a 90 -person central committee , which will choose a new 21 -member national leadership .
the congress also elected 20 members to join bashar on the party 's executive , the baath 's most powerful policy-making body .
within hours of the death , the 250 -seat baath -dominated parliament lowered the minimum age for president from 40 to 34 -- making bashar eligible for the post .
the baath party has ruled syria since 1963 .
observers suggested they had been organized along the lines of the different government ministries , political youth organizations , and baath party districts .
in the days since his father 's death , the machinery of the all-important military and the ruling baath party , the main elements of his father 's authoritarian rule , have moved rapidly to elevate the young man .
major military figures as well as some in the baath party were seated tuesday on one side of the hall where bashar assad received visitors .
the party already has announced an initial nomination of bashar assad for president , and a formal nomination is expected to be announced during the conference .
the standing delegates then chanted the party anthem without music or applause .
it was unclear when during the five-day conference the party members would elect bashar assad to lead the party , or when they would nominate him for the presidency .
the proceedings were also to focus on assessing the party 's rule .
in an opening speech , suleiman qaddah , assistant secretary-general of the party , vowed it would remain loyal to assad 's policies .
the 250 -seat parliament , where baathists enjoy a clear majority , is expected to set a date for a presidential referendum in which bashar is likely to be the only candidate .
the ideology and slogans of the party today remain relevant , '' he told the congress , the party 's first in 15 years .
the party reshuffle is part of a carefully laid out script to pass the leadership mantle to bashar , a former eye doctor , and to ensure that the transition is smooth .
'' absolute loyalty to gen . bashar assad , leader of the march of the people and the party , '' read the front-page headline in al-baath , the party 's mouthpiece .
the party nominated him as their chief , and newspapers and the state propaganda machine began churning out editorials , posters and banners declaring bashar the nation 's hope for the future .
a fourth party in the case -- former premier mahmoud el-zoubi -- committed suicide may 21 as he was about to be served a judicial summons .
his party nominated him for president and is to confirm the nomination on june 17 at the first major party congress in nearly two decades .
in the last two years , the late president purged old timers from the military and the party who were likely to pose a threat to his son .
but there was little doubt saturday that the late president 's wish was being honored and that bashar assad , a british -educated ophthalmologist , was headed for the presidency .
assad brought bashar home from britain where he was studying to be an eye doctor to prepare him for the presidency after his eldest son , bassil , died in a car crash 1994 .
instead , less than two hours after the public announcement of the president 's death , parliament amended the constitution to lower the age limit for the presidency from 40 to 34 .
technically , the syrian constitution provides for a vice president to take over if the presidency becomes vacant .
analysts are divided over whether bashar 's ascension to the presidency would set a good example for the rest of the arab world .
parliament formally announced that bashar assad 's swearing-in ceremony will be on july 17 , after which he will embark on a seven-year term that is full of risks .
assad , an ophthalmologist by training , officially began a seven-year term after taking the oath of office before the 250 -member syrian parliament .
lahoud congratulated assad on winning his fifth seven-year term as president in a referendum held in syria on thursday , in which assad was the only candidate .
hafez assad received between 99.6 and 99.99 percent of the vote in his presidential referendums , which , like monday 's , were orchestrated by the baath party
recovering the golan heights , the syrian plateau that was occupied by israel in the 1967 arab-israeli war , is a top priority , assad said .
`` however long it takes , this land is ours and it will return to us in full , '' he said .
syrian - israeli peace negotiations have been frozen since mid-january , mainly over the future of a small strip of land that borders the sea of galilee , the major source of israel 's water .
he pledged to reform the syrian economy , which remains largely state-controlled and dependent on oil exports , by streamlining the government bureaucracy .
syrian business owners , who have labored under a system with no private banks and strict controls on currency flows , have urged a major overhaul of the economic system .
syrian newspapers , which are all run by the state , said he did not want to see his picture adorning every public and private building .
syrian president hafez al-assad held two meetings with lahoud on developing bilateral ties in all areas , the syrian - arab news agency quoted presidential spokesman as saying .
they also insisted that the syrian - israeli and the lebanese - israeli tracks in the middle east peace process can not be separated .
born in jaffa in then- palestine in 1937 , abu nidal 's main targets have been israelis .
born in jaffa in 1937 , he has ordered the killing of 150 of his own operatives on suspicion of treason , which accounts for his ability to elude authorities around the world for so long .
the opposition party organ wafd , quoting palestinian sources , reported on monday that abu nidal , a palestinian born in jaffa in 1937 , is suffering from terminal leukaemia and receiving treatment in an egyptian hospital .
where is abu nidal ?
a onetime guerrilla colleague , confronted with the question , replies with one of his own : which abu nidal ?
the comment says much about abu nidal _ arabic for `` father of struggle '' _ whom the united states once labeled the world 's most dangerous terrorist .
over the years abu nidal has been reported to have died _ but then suddenly reappeared _ or to have totally changed his looks through plastic surgery .
the officials spoke on condition their names not be used , remaining as anonymous as the sources claiming abu nidal is in egypt .
the reports persist because of abu nidal 's fame .
palestinian officials have told the associated press that abu nidal _ whose real name is sabri al-banna _ is either jailed or hospitalized in egypt .
but no one has offered definite proof that abu nidal is indeed in custody in egypt .
one high-ranking palestinian , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said wednesday that abu nidal was seized by the egyptians about five weeks ago coming from libya .
he said he was uncertain if libya arranged for the palestinian guerrilla to leave for medical reasons of if abu nidal 's own people were trying to smuggle him out through egypt to another country .
abu nidal is near death and , though he is being treated in a hospital , he is in effect in detention , the official contended .
over the years abu nidal is said to have operated out of iraq , syria and libya .
it was a palestinian in lebanon who asked the question about `` which abu nidal , '' raising the theory that the famous terrorist actually is dead and that some followers have used his famous nom de guerre .
the palestinian , once close to abu nidal 's group , spoke on condition of anonymity .
over the years , the chain-smoking abu nidal has been reported to be dead of cancer or a heart attack .
i am abu nidal of flesh and blood ...
the comment says much about abu nidal , whom the united states once labeled the world 's most dangerous terrorist .
over the years abu nidal , whose nickname is arabic for `` father of struggle , '' has been reported to have died _ but then suddenly reappeared _ or to have totally changed his looks through plastic surgery .
over the years , the chain-smoking abu nidal has been reported to have died of cancer or a heart attack .
a high-ranking palestinian official said wednesday that the notorious terrorist abu nidal has been detained in egypt , but the country 's foreign minister denied the report .
the interest in abu nidal _ arabic for `` father of struggle '' _ comes because of his notoriety for his daring attacks on israelis and even palestinians whom he opposed , and for the mystery surrounding him .
in recent days , several palestinian officials insisting on anonymity have told news organizations , including the associated press , that abu nidal was either jailed or hospitalized with leukemia .
he said he was uncertain if libya arranged for the 61-year-old palestinian to leave or if abu nidal 's own people were trying to smuggle him out through egypt to another country .
abu nidal is near death and being treated in a hospital , but is in effect in detention by egyptian officials , the official contended .
he theorized egypt is denying the arrest because it does not know what to do with abu nidal and fears revealing his arrest could make egypt the target of anger by other terrorists .
he was asked about reports tuesday and wednesday by american newspapers and broadcasters which quoted u.s . and arab officials as saying abu nidal had been arrested by egyptian police .
`` abu nidal is not in egypt , '' moussa replied .
in washington , the state department 's intelligence and counterterrorism offices could not confirm reports of abu nidal 's arrest .
abu nidal 's group has been listed by the u.s . state department as `` the most dangerous terrorist organization . ''
however , most of the incidents blamed on abu nidal occurred years ago , and he is now believed to have only a few hundred followers , mostly in lebanon .
abu nidal , 61 , is accused by washington of having killed or injured 900 people in attacks in 20 countries since 1974 .
the arab intelligence official , who spoke tuesday on the condition of anonymity , said abu nidal was arrested two months ago in egypt but had actually been there for nine months .
the official said egyptian intelligence agents wanted to use abu nidal 's network to target terrorist groups planning bombings and assassinations in egypt .
at that point , according to the official , abu nidal stopped cooperating and was arrested .
last week , egyptian officials denied that abu nidal was on egyptian territory after two arabic newspapers asserted he was under arrest in egypt .
al sharq al-awsat reported on aug . 23 that abu nidal was dying of cancer in an egyptian hospital .
the los angeles times reported on tuesday that abu nidal had been arrested by egyptian authorities as he crossed into egypt from libya .
although the abu nidal group is smaller now than it had been in the past , it continues to have adherents in lebanon , syria , libya , iraq and according to intelligence officials several dormant cells in europe .
abu nidal is wanted in italy , the united states , the united kingdom .
moussa was telling reporters here in response to some media reports in the last couple of weeks that the 61-year-old man , who is known by his nom de guerre as abu nidal , is in egypt .
palestinian officials have told the associated press that abu nidal _ whose real name is sabri al-banna _ is either jailed or hospitalized in egypt .
that was the name of the shadowy figure who ray , after recanting his confession , claimed had manipulated him into the plot .
the wagons carried food and white boxes with large blue circles bearing the name of the donor , doctors of the world .
but now in a final , posthumous novel to be published next year for the centennial of his birth , the adventurer and prankster who was hemingway can keep readers guessing .
a thriving afterlife as a brand name .
however , most of the incidents blamed on abu nidal occurred years ago , and he is now believed to have only a few hundred followers , mostly in lebanon .
abu nidal still has 200 to 300 followers in his organization , and they have been active in recent years , especially against arab targets .
abu nidal , 61 , is accused by washington of having killed or injured 900 people in attacks in 20 countries since 1974 .
the plo has condemned to death in 1974 .
the plo condemned abu nidal to death in 1974 .
he is wanted in the united states , great britain and italy and was condemned to death by the palestine liberation organization , from which he broke in 1972 .
over the years , reports of his death , often spun by the man himself , have circulated widely .
the official 's account could not be independently confirmed , but it was supported on some points by a plo official .
over the past decade he included the plo among his targets having taken responsibility for killing some the organization 's top leaders .
plo officials said egypt would not confirm these reports to them , but left open the possibility the arrest may have taken place .
over the years , his death has been reported widely in accounts often spun by the man himself .
in washington on tuesday , thomas pickering , undersecretary of state , said he did not have `` any determinative information '' to provide on the reported arrest , and said questions should be addressed to the egyptian government .
klein is allegedly a former accomplice of cold war terrorist ilich ramirez sanchez , better known as `` carlos the jackal . ''
orders for the attack are believed to have come from ilich ramirez sanchez , the man known as carlos the jackal , who is in a french jail serving a life sentence for three other murders .
klein , believed to be a former accomplice of cold war terrorist ilich ramirez sanchez , also known as `` carlos the jackal , '' has been sought on an international arrest warrant for 23 years .
the daily evenimentul zilei reported recently that some former securitate agents could be indicted in france for collaborating with `` carlos the jackal , '' whose real name is ilich ramirez sanchez .
voinea announced that romania charged carlos , whose real name is ilich ramirez sanchez , of undermining the peace and committing crimes against humanity .
carlos , a venezuelan whose real name is ilich ramirez sanchez , was arrested in sudan in 1994 .
his expulsion came a year after the sudanese government had arrested and extradited ilich ramirez sanchez , better known as the terrorist `` carlos the jackal , '' to france .
klein lived under a false name in the norman village of sainte-honorine-la-guillaume until his arrest under an old warrant .
germany is interested not only in what klein might have to say about carlos ' terror network , but also about activities at the time of the stasi , the east german secret police .
`` the german secret service told us carlos rented a car in germany using false documents provided by romania , '' voinea said .
after a four-year trial , an accused terrorist and a former accomplice of carlos the jackal will be sentenced next week in a bombing attack on a french cultural center , a berlin court said monday .
germany 's longest-sought fugitive until his 1995 arrest in yemen , weinrich is a former red army faction member who also headed european operations for international terrorist carlos the jackal in the 1970s and '80s .
prosecutors say the berlin bombing was one in a series of unsuccessful attempts to pressure france to free carlos ' lover and another member of his terrorist gang from a french prison .
he was held in la sante prison where carlos the jackal , nickname for venezuelan -born ilich ramirez sanchez , is held .
in the letter , chavez addressed the venezuelan -born carlos as `` dear compatriot '' and , according to press reports , signed the missive `` with profound faith in the cause and the mission , now and forever. ''
carlos , a venezuelan whose real name is ilich ramirez sanchez , was arrested in sudan in 1994 .
he even penned a friendly letter to an infamous venezuelan -born terrorist , `` carlos the jackal , '' who is serving a life term in a french prison .
one peculiar example is his correspondence with ilich ramirez sanchez , the venezuelan -born former guerrilla known as carlos the jackal , who was convicted of murder and kidnappings across europe , including an attack on opec ministers .
relatives of the man known as carlos the jackal have praised a letter of solidarity sent to the convicted terrorist by venezuela 's president .
`` chavez is almost a mythical figure , '' said carlos sabino , a sociologist at the central university of venezuela and longtime observer of the country 's politics .
hugo rafael chavez frias was born in sabaneta de barinas , a small town in the vast , sparsely-populated savannah that is venezuela 's equivalent of the great plains .
born to a poor family in the western interior city of barinas , chavez 's first dreams were about the major leagues .
they also said they discovered a romanian bank account some dlrs 1,000 in under the name of ramirez 's ex-wife , magdalena kopp .
ramirez was captured in sudan in august 1994 and sentenced last year in paris to life in prison for the 1975 triple murder .
ramirez , who was captured in 1994 , is believed responsible for the death of at least 83 people .

the protests pale in comparison to events leading up to cassini 's october 1997 launch , when demonstrators threatened to chain themselves to the pad and filed lawsuits to stop the mission .
cassini has twice used the gravity of venus to increase its speed since its launch in october 1997 .
about 500 people protested the space agency 's most recent launch of an rtg-powered probe , the cassini spacecraft launched toward saturn in 1997 , because it carries about 72 pounds of plutonium .
cassini was launched in october 1997 , and a previous venus approach took place in april 1998 .
the plutonium-powered cassini spacecraft remained in contact with its operations team .
program manager bob mitchell said engineering data from the spacecraft are being transmitted to earth to help engineers pinpoint what caused cassini to enter the safe mode .
jpl said engineers suspect that during a tracking maneuver , cassini 's star scanner may have viewed a patch of sky without the bright stars the spacecraft uses to orient itself in space .
mitchell said he expects cassini will be taken out of safe mode later this week after the problem has been identified and data thoroughly analyzed .
it passed venus last year and this year will use venus again and then swoop within 500 miles of earth , an encounter that also worries cassini opponents .
cassini 's return , two years after nasa launched the largest and most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever , poses virtually no risk , mission officials say .
the plutonium-powered galileo probe to jupiter twice swung by earth in the early 1990s at altitudes much lower than cassini 's closest point .
the chances of an accidental re-entry of cassini are about 1 in 1.2 million , according to a nasa estimate .
`` it 's just not a credible event , '' said bob mitchell , cassini 's program manager at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena .
a handful of anti- cassini web sites also have been set up .
the plutonium-powered cassini spacecraft flew within 728 miles of earth 's surface , successfully using the planet 's gravity to gain speed and change direction for the final stretch of its journey to saturn .
`` it was right by the book , '' said bob mitchell , cassini 's program manager at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena .
but concern over the safety of nuclear-powered spacecraft are not likely to diminish as the $ 3.4 billion cassini speeds away .
activists had feared that human error or some other mishap could fling cassini and its 72 pounds of radioactive plutonium into earth 's atmosphere .
before cassini 's launch , protesters filed lawsuits and threatened to chain themselves to the pad .
cassini does n't use the plutonium for propulsion but to power its dozen instruments .
once it arrives at saturn , cassini will make close-up studies of the planet , its rings , moons and magnetic environment .
cassini 's two rtgs have been feeding it electrical power steadily and should continue to work long after the spacecraft loops into orbit around saturn in 2004 .
cassini 's crucial course
the cassini spacecraft has made the second of its two flybys of venus , using the planet 's gravity to pick up speed on its way to saturn , which it should reach in 2004 .
the next planet to provide a shot of energy to the spacecraft is earth , which cassini will approach next month .
once they reach their target , they will seek out raw materials , build sensors and an antenna , then relay images back home .
no more behemoths that cost many billions of dollars apiece would be built to explore outer space .
instead , he vowed to tap american ingenuity to build swarms of small but powerful spacecraft that would probe the heavens , sending back a nearly constant stream of new information .
`` there 's a balance between science return , acceptance of risk and cost reduction , '' he said .
`` those have gotten out of balance , with too much emphasis on cost reduction .
but the idea of doing missions more rapidly and at lower cost certainly is still valid .
the issue is how rapidly and how much cost reduction. ''
europe 's space consortium cooperated with the u.s . -launched cassini probe to saturn but has not conducted its own mission .
about 500 people protested the space agency 's most recent launch of an rtg-powered probe , the cassini spacecraft launched toward saturn in 1997 , because it carries about 72 pounds of plutonium .
cassini 's destination , eventually , is the ringed planet saturn .
washington , october 15 -lrb- xinhua -rrb- -- cassini , the probe destined for saturn , took off early this morning on a seven-year journey to explore the remote planet and its rings and moons .
on its billions of kilometers flight toward saturn , cassini is scheduled to loop its path around the venus , the earth and the jupiter to get the gravity boost needed for closing in onto its destination .
cassini 's two rtgs have been feeding it electrical power steadily and should continue to work long after the spacecraft loops into orbit around saturn in 2004 .

most kurds are secular muslims who belong to the main sunni sect .
they also provoked the turkish army into attacks that nearly obliterated kurdish towns _ and in many cases turned kurds against the pkk .
the violent protests by kurds across europe gives the impression that the protesters must all be members of the pkk or that ocalan is a leader to all kurds .
the kurds are also protesting the repressive political , social , economic and military conditions that exist in turkey and which continue to smear turkey 's human rights record .
if that 's not enough , the kurds are also using ocalan 's capture to inform the world that all 25 million of them remain stateless .
divided by the states where they live , by tribal and political allegiances that make them willing and unwilling pawns in regional and international affairs , the kurds are as complex as the region where most of them live .

no friend of saddam hussein , syria opened its border with iraq in a vain attempt to help the iraqi kurds resist him after the gulf war .

ocalan leads the kurdistan workers party , or pkk , which has waged a 14-year-old war for kurdish autonomy in southeastern turkey .
kurds in cities across europe protested his arrest with marches , sit-ins , hunger strikes , self-immolations and a suicide bombing .
the people of turkey protested with almost equal fervor when italy freed ocalan , burning italian clothes and cars and launching boycotts that brought threats of european union sanctions against turkey .

granting ocalan asylum would further enrage turkey , a nato ally and major trading partner , as well as the united states , which wants him prosecuted .

ocalan was willing to stand trial , the lawyers said _ but not in turkey or germany .

fearing unrest among germany 's many turkish kurds , chancellor gerhard schroeder on friday ruled out seeking ocalan 's extradition on murder and terror charges .
even as the politicians met in bonn , 11,000 turkish kurds rallied nearby to support the rebel leader .
some beat drums and carried photographs of ocalan , whose outlawed kurdish workers party , or pkk , has fought a 14-year war for kurdish autonomy in turkey .
after the meeting , schroeder said germany and italy will work with turkey to help it resolve the question of kurdish autonomy at home .
`` we want a friendly , normal relations with turkey , '' the chancellor said .
ocalan _ a fugitive from terror and murder charges in turkey , where he faces the death penalty _ was arrested nov . 12 when he arrived at the rome airport aboard a flight from moscow .
the decision enraged many in turkey who consider ocalan their most-wanted criminal .

the head of the kurdish communities in germany , mehmet tanriverdi , has asked the german government to help reach a political settlement in turkey on the question of kurdish autonomy .
by the end of the day , many hundreds of kurds had been arrested and some of the hostages _ but not all _ had been released .
at least three kurds in european cities had set themselves on fire , including a 17-year-old girl in germany , who like the others was seriously injured .
the kurds in europe did not focus their anger on turkey , which captured ocalan in nairobi , kenya , late on monday .

but there were also demonstrations of joy in turkey by other turks , who view ocalan as a terrorist .
there are more than 20 million kurds in turkey and nearby countries , who have long suffered persecution by successive governments of countries in which they live .
ocalan has led a 14-year often-violent guerrilla movement for kurdish self-rule and civil rights in turkey , which has been met with violent repression by the government .
the streets of athens were relatively quiet on tuesday , perhaps because greek police rounded up more than 350 kurds preemptively early in the morning and held them in an abandoned army camp .
in the evening , under tight security , a rally of greeks and kurds in support of ocalan took place in downtown athens without incident .
`` these attacks were n't really organized , '' said mehmet atac , a 28-year-old kurd who was among several hundred who stood vigil outside the greek consulate in frankfurt this afternoon after kurds occupied it .
`` we will stay here until we get some answers from the greek authorities , '' one of the kurds occupying the greek embassy in london told a british radio station .
another of the kurds inside the embassy , who gave his name only as ofter , told reporters by telephone : `` we are completely committed .
about 500,000 kurds live in germany , including 10,000 in frankfurt .
otto schily , the german interior minister , pleaded with the kurds to leave the various consulates peacefully .
police in frankfurt used truncheons and water cannons to subdue kurds who were turning over cars .
`` this is a matter that only affects the countries involved _ those that extradited him and turkey , '' he said .
for months , ocalan had appealed to european countries for political asylum or an international trial that would allow him to avoid being deported to turkey , where he could face the death penalty .

kurds share a common language , related to iran 's farsi , and many are muslims .

a ban imposed by turkey 's last military government on the use of kurdish in unofficial settings was lifted in 1991 , but kurdish is illegal in broadcasts and in educational or political settings .
a court case to ban turkey 's main pro- kurdish party is under way .
italy had refused to extradite him to turkey last november , citing a law that bans italy from extraditing prisoners to countries that use capital punishment .
walter veltroni , leader of the largest party in italy 's center-left government , warned turkey on tuesday not to apply the death penalty , saying , `` that would place turkey irretrievably outside europe . ''
although there was no clear evidence that the protests were orchestrated , kurds held rallies , seized consulates , battled police and threatened mass suicides .
by the end of the day , many hundreds of kurds had been arrested , and most of the almost two dozen hostages had been released .
kurds share a common language , related to persian , and many are muslims .
ankara , turkey _ the emotions of 25 million people without a state seized the world 's television screens last week .
the kurds want self-determination , but no one else seems ready to take up their cause .
they are muslim farmers , merchants and nomads -- scattered across turkey , iraq , iran and syria .
with `` no friend but the mountains , '' as their self-pitying legend goes , the kurds have long been cloaked in relative obscurity .
`` and clearly it is not only turkey 's problem , but the world 's , '' said sedat yurtdas , 38 , a moderate kurdish politician and lawyer whose activities have been banned by the turkish government .
the entebbe -style capture of ocalan in kenya by turkish commandos was widely celebrated in turkey , comparable to if israel had nabbed yasser arafat amid the palestinian terrorist movement in the 1970s .
he is routinely referred to in turkey 's pro-government press as `` the babykiller. ''
still , the question nagging turkey is : what next ?
the guerrilla movement is still active , there are millions of kurds living in europe .
a sobering problem for turkey is the delicate matter of how to handle ocalan 's upcoming trial and anticipated conviction , after which he could be sentenced to death .
ocalan and the pkk 's brutal tactics have been loathed by many moderate kurds .
but turkey risks turning ocalan into a martyr for all kurds if the trial is viewed as a sham and ocalan is put to death .
in the immediate aftermath of ocalan 's arrest , kurds living abroad and linked by e-mail and a europe -based satellite tv station , took the streets and occupied embassy buildings in more than 20 european cities .
only one other man has done as much to publicize the plight of the kurds .
a vindictive saddam hussein sought to annihilate iraqi kurds in the north of his country in the aftermath of the 1991 gulf war .
with american and united nations help , the kurds in northern iraq are largely running their own affairs , without realizing their ultimate goal of sovereignty .
even the most militant of kurds began to set their sights lower ; in turkey , ocalan relinquished the goal of an independent statehood , calling instead for limited autonomy within turkey 's borders .
on friday , the state department acknowledged that the u.s . intelligence services helped turkey track down and capture ocalan , who had looking for a hiding place since mid-october when he was forced from his haven in syria .
if turkey 's relentless military and security offensive is the stick , ecevit offered a carrot this week in proclaiming a campaign to increase investment and improve roads in mainly kurdish southeastern turkey .
undoubtedly , the kurds will be looking for more .
but turkey 's chief prosecutor has begun legal proceedings to bar the pro- kurdish people 's democracy party -lrb- hadep -rrb- .
if outlawed , it would be the fourth political party sympathetic to the kurds to be banned in turkey during this decade .
`` the arrest has placed the eyes of the world on turkey .
it is an important test , not only for the future of the kurds but for turkey 's reputation in the world , '' he said .
turkey can take comfort in the fact that during his months on the run , no european country would offer ocalan refuge .
but now that it has him in custody , the government here appears to be ignoring demands by international human rights groups for greater tolerance towards the kurds and a fair trial for ocalan .
turkey is preparing a closed trial before a military tribunal for the rebel leader and has rejected attempts of ocalan 's european lawyers to enter the country to confer with him .
back in turkey , the threat of new violence was faxed friday to the associated press .
ocalan 's pkk warned that turkey would `` face the consequences '' if ocalan were harmed .
`` if turkey has a genuine intention to solve this problem peacefully , it is high time to do it now .
there would be no reason for kurds to rebel if we were allowed to be part of the system. ''

about 17 percent , or $ 1.75 billion , of burger king 's $ 10.3 billion in sales last year came from soft drinks , according to jim watkins , the company 's vice president for marketing .
although the process costs more , says the company with 9 billion u.s . dollars sales last year , the prices are not going to rise as increased business should cover the increased cost .
under pressure from restaurant owners , burger king said tuesday it 's not for sale and believes that most franchisees are confident about a $ 500 million plan to help revitalize the brand .
the national franchisee association inc . , an organization of burger king franchise holders , said monday it is exploring the idea of spinning the company off from british parent diageo plc .

the average burger king now rings up about $ 1.1 million in sales a year , the company said .

-lrb- she will be the chairwoman and a part owner of the new company . -rrb-
it 's no surprise , then , that newhouse has decided to merge the magazine into his conde nast empire .
next year , the the new yorker 's sinecured staffers will move into conde
nast 's new headquarters and will fight for phone lines and desk space with the rest of si 's magazines .
new york _ it was the closest you could get to a debutante party in the mud-slinging , ego-bruising , advertising-hungry world of magazine publishing .
's newest joint venture _ who sat , smiles firmly in place , at a table behind ms . black , in their first public appearance as affianced partners of the hearst company .
the company 's two other joint ventures , smart money -lrb- which is published in conjunction with dow jones & co .
-rrb- and marie claire -lrb- with marie claire album , a french company -rrb- are two of the strongest titles in the industry .
but not all eyes will remain glued to talk ; many will be monitoring ms . black 's progress in changing the company to increase advertising revenue .
ms . black has changed the company slowly ; in three years , she has fired or reassigned only a handful of publishers and editors .
she has concentrated on rehabilitating the magazine company 's image among advertisers , who had grumbled loudly in 1995 when hearst cut its magazines ' guaranteed circulation rates .
in december _ in another advertiser -oriented move _ she restructured the company 's magazines into two groups , in an attempt to encourage advertisers to buy pages in several magazines at once , in effect offering package deals .
like her company , ms . black is frill-free .
hearst is a privately held company , and ms . black will not discuss numbers , even good ones , choosing instead to highlight the successes of smart money and cosmopolitan .
at conde nast , they love to toss the thing around .
former hearst editors say the company 's culture is not directed toward creative tinkering .
`` at conde nast , editors are treated like entertainment impresarios .
while the talk deal is a change of tactics for hearst , it signals a shift for the magazine industry in general as more companies move toward joint ventures in a publishing economy that feels increasingly unsure .
e . daniel capell , an authority on magazine circulation and the editor of capell 's circulation report , said that joint ventures are very appealing , especially to a company like hearst .
other issues were bandied about in the brand-new conde nast headquarters in times square in manhattan .
three of the company 's publications , wired , architectural digest and bon appetit , are based in california but have business offices at 4 times square , ms . perl said .
new york _ with the coordination of an invading army , conde nast has begun moving its glossy fashion magazines into a new home at 4 times square , the first skyscraper built in new york city since 1992 .
since conde nast signed a deal for the building nearly three years ago , times square has become one of the most sought-after commercial neighborhoods in the city .
reuters recently started work on its new headquarters across from 4 times square , and ernst & young , the accounting firm , is close to a deal to build its own tower nearby .
conde nast will be moving from its old-money environs on the east side , within easy reach of brooks brothers , paul stuart and patroon , to the hurly-burly of times square .
it was douglas durst , the developer of 4 times square , who persuaded conde nast to make the move .
truman , the editorial director , said conde nast had a choice of either leaving its longtime home on madison avenue for a year while the space there was renovated , or moving permanently to a new building .
drew schutte , who 's been with the magazine since 1994 , ascended to the publisher 's post but is based in new york , home of wired parent conde nast .
`` the whole thing was to engage women and get them to take action , '' said cara deoul perl , the vice president for creative marketing at conde nast in new york , a unit of advance publications .
`` and the company was not madly for adlai .
newhouse averaged half that figure , although he pulled out all the stops when it came to the company 's cafeteria , where , executives said , spending exceeded $ 400 a square foot .
the company chose to bring the magazines , scattered among six buildings , into the same tower .
instead of giving all the window space to ranking executives , the company has decided to let many employees labor at metallic blue workstations near the windows .
the company had just been bought by walt disney co . as part of the capital cities acquisition , and disney did not seem a natural fit .
kenneth cole , whose footwear and clothing company earned $ 218 million in revenue in 1998 , said the situation resembled a kind of monopoly on style .
advertisers such as ralph lauren and kenneth cole have found it `` easy to add wired to the plan '' of other conde nast buys , such as vanity fair , the new yorker , vogue and gq .
he has some other tricks up his sleeve as well : in july , digimarc , an oregon company , will give special pc devices to 25,000 wired subscribers .
in october , a company called digital convergence will send similarly equipped laser `` pens '' that link to the pc to every wired subscriber , so that they can read bar codes and launch web sites .
meanwhile , schutte 's old boss lyon is working feverishly to start her new company , one ventures , which will produce a magazine and web site devoted to all things design this fall .
magazine , will be editor in chief of the san francisco company .
also in the crowd , for the two earlier attempts and friday morning 's as well , were collins ' husband , pat youngs , an airline pilot , and their 3-year-old daughter , bridget marie .
`` it really did n't matter to me whether i was selected as a pilot or a mission specialist , '' she said .
collins , who lives with her family in houston , said she would not mind if everyone else viewed her achievements the way bridget marie did when the 3-year-old found out that mom would be commanding a shuttle mission .

mitchell , acting as clinton 's envoy , shepherded the warring factions in northern ireland to the political settlement known as the good friday agreement in april 1998 .
mitchell , a former u.s . senator , chaired the negotiations that produced the good friday 1998 agreement on forming a new protestant - catholic government for northern ireland .
major will perhaps be best remembered for the advances he made towards northern ireland peace , paving the way for the good friday agreement of 1998 .
magee is the 277th prisoner to be given early release under the good friday agreement , a landmark deal signed by northern ireland ' s feuding political groups in april 1998 aimed at ending 30 years of violence .
mike hammer , a spokesman for the national security council , said they focused on all aspects of implementing the good friday accord , the historical peace agreement signed by the parties in 1998 .
the april 1998 good friday peace agreement could go into cold storage if there is no movement on the arms issue , he added .
he noted the british government had `` made a commitment '' in the 1998 good friday agreement to demilitarization .
that 1998 agreement stated that paramilitary groups should finish disarming by this may , but it set no date for the process to begin .
london and dublin are struggling to find ways of reviving the political institutions by may 22 , which the 1998 agreement set as the date for a completion of an arms handover .
he added : `` there is no credible alternative to the good friday agreement .
in a letter to the huntingdon conservative association , the 56-year-old major said he had made his decision after '' a great deal of soul-searching and sadness. ''
that agreement designed the local power-sharing government that gave the province partial home rule briefly this winter .
and for his tireless efforts and determination to bring peace to northern ireland which laid the foundations for the good friday agreement , '' hague said .
unionists refused to form a power-sharing government with sinn fein , called for under the agreement , until the ira turned in its weapons .
`` there was an agreement , but there was no trust , '' mitchell said .
british prime minister tony blair and his irish counterpart , bertie ahern , had spent all their political capital earlier that month , setting deadlines that passed without agreement or sanction .
mitchell had set a deadline last year , convinced that the parties would not reach an agreement without one .
he barely made it back in time to deliver the eulogy .
ahern said progress had been made , but did not elaborate .
sinn fein leader gerry adams said trimble had no right to set deadlines unilaterally , and accused the british government of acting illegally by allowing trimble to alter the terms of the good friday agreement .
`` we will continue to fight , '' thompson said , `` until trimble and this agreement are finished. ''
but under the terms of the good friday agreement , magee became eligible for early release after serving only about a third of his sentence .
there was considerable progress made toward the end of last year . ''
he noted that the purpose of the meeting was to have a `` strategic view of what needs to be done to bring about the full implementation of all aspects of the good friday agreement . ''
so let 's go forward empowered by the progress that has made life so much better for people on the island of ireland , '' he added .
britain said the irish republican army 's failure to give a clear commitment to hand in arms in line with the landmark good friday peace agreement left it with no choice .
`` the good friday agreement is the foundation upon which new relationships between unionists and nationalists and republicans can be forged , '' he said .
newport plans to retrieve the recovery vessel first , then go after liberty bell 7 , the only u.s . manned spacecraft lost after a successful mission .
once liberty bell 7 was safely aboard ship , newport rummaged through the spacecraft , which had a sulfurous odor .
for the next six months , technicians will disassemble , clean and reassemble liberty bell 7 , the mercury space capsule that rested in the depths of the atlantic ocean for 38 years before being recovered july 20 .
the 7 1/2-foot aluminum-and- titanium capsule sank after splashdown on july 21 , 1961 , when its hatch blew open prematurely and the spacecraft filled with water .
a 180-foot ship , the needham tide , headed for the 3-mile- deep waters 300 miles southeast of cape canaveral .
the ship was a day late raising anchor ; the crew needed time to get a new switch for a hydraulic power unit .
newport estimated it would take at least one day to reach the area where he believes grissom 's liberty bell 7 lies on the ocean floor .
liberty bell 7 sank 38 years ago this month .
`` it will be a big relief '' once the capsule is aboard ship , curt newport said before setting sail thursday .
newport and his team discovered liberty bell 7 on may 1 about 300 miles southeast of cape canaveral .
the houston company also supplied a bigger ship for this trip , which is expected to last 1 1/2 to two weeks .
newport expects liberty bell 7 to be on deck by the end of next week if all goes well .
an underwater salvage team spent eight hours in darkness late monday and early yesterday reeling in the liberty bell 7 flown by astronaut gus grissom , the second american in space .
it arrived by ship at cape canaveral this morning , the 38th anniversary of its sinking after splashdown .
so it was almost like having this thing punch to the surface through some type of time portal or something , '' he said in a ship -to-shore news conference .
when newport finally located the capsule again , the ship 's robot vessel was used to attach a sling to the capsule .
because of problems recovering liberty bell 7 -- two days were wasted because of bad navigational data and the recovery vessel kept breaking -- newport had no time to search for the hatch .
the answer to the enduring mystery of why the hatch blew may have been in the inside-the-capsule camera that was running when liberty bell 7 splashed down .
the recovery project was financed by the discovery channel , which plans to broadcast a two-hour special , `` in search of liberty bell 7 , '' on dec . 12 .
once the restoration is complete , the discovery channel will take liberty bell 7 on a three-year tour , beginning about the middle of 2000 .
the crew plans to set sail sunday with the latest in side-scan sonar in hopes of finding liberty bell 7 , lost at sea 38 years ago .
two cameras and a tape recorder that sank with the capsule could shed light on what happened , but it 's doubtful the film and tape could be salvaged after so long underwater .
`` she has done a great job so far with the stock , '' said alberto vilar , president of amerindo investment advisors , and one of ebay 's largest shareholders .
as one prominent technology investor , alberto vilar of the $ 7.5 billion amerindo investment advisors , put it , `` tell me a money manager that does n't listen to uncle alan . ''
now , after putting in his usual 12-hour day managing his company 's nearly $ 3 billion in growth stock portfolios , he takes a shower , steps into his tuxedo and heads for the met .
an indonesian business connection prompted him to form the american - indonesian investment co . , but there was never any investment from indonesia and he shortened the name to amerindo .
the privately held company , of which vilar is president and a leading partner , manages institutional portfolios specializing in technology and health care .
so it would take more than internet stock options in a company she had never heard of for ms . whitman to give up the peaceful life she enjoyed with her husband and two sons in boston .
and 14 months ago , she packed up her family and moved to california to begin preparing ebay for the initial public stock offering that the company 's founder , pierre m . omidyar , was already mulling .

austin , texas _ two public interest groups monday asked a federal court to strike down the money-riddled system of electing state judges , contending that it violates texans ' right to fair and impartial courtrooms .
`` texas has become notorious across the country as a state where ` justice is for sale , '' ' said tom `` smitty '' smith of public citizen inc . , one of the plaintiffs .
it was filed in u.s . district court by public citizen , the gray panthers and five individual texas lawyers .
supreme court chief justice tom phillips , an early supporter of efforts to junk the current system , called it a `` bad system that impairs public confidence in the courts . ''
smith of public citizen said the legislature `` has clearly had the opportunity and failed to remedy this problem. ''
the tactic drew criticism from house members and a public advocacy group that accused the agency of delaying publicizing reports on the workplace dangers of a toxic chemical featured in the film , `` erin brockovich . ''
but carol browner , the epa administrator , predicted that congress would not vote to stop the rules if it involved `` a full review , and a public review. ''
scientists for the group , public citizen , asserted that the epa had for five years delayed publicizing reports that the chemical was far more dangerous than previously thought .
public citizen also accused the occupational safety and health administration of delays in issuing tougher rules to protect workers from the compound .
peter lurie , deputy director of public citizens ' health research group , said the delays in regulating the compound reflected what he called the administration 's systematic underenforcement in occupational safety .
he insisted that public citizen 's attacks were not intended to advance nader 's candidacy .
but public citizen scientists , who obtained the study through the freedom of information act , faulted the agency for waiting five years before publishing the findings .
public citizen officials complained tuesday that no rule has been yet proposed , though osha officials said they plan to issue a rule by june 2001 .

sen . james m . inhofe , r - okla . , a leader of the opposition to the nomination , accused clinton of `` utter contempt of the senate and its role in the confirmation process. ''
the associated press erroneously reported last thursday that sen . james inhofe , r - okla . , was the lone senator who did not vote when the senate confirmed lawrence summers to be treasury secretary .
sen . james inhofe , r - okla . , accused the president of undermining a spirit of cooperation when he made 17 temporary appointments while the senate was not in session during august .
inhofe , r - okla . , was not injured , but his single-engine airplane was slightly damaged , said press secretary danny finnerty .
inhofe , an experienced , commercially rated pilot , was en route from northeastern oklahoma to oklahoma city , where he was to meet president , who was touring tornado-ravaged parts of central oklahoma .
sen . james inhofe of oklahoma is currently in line to ascend to the chairmanship , holding the greatest seniority among the panel 's gop members .
in addition , he attended gop fund-raising events in his home state and washington .
sen . james inhofe of oklahoma , who is one seat below smith on the panel , has also made clear his desire for the chairmanship .
the oklahoma republican said clinton violated the agreement in august with ' '17 recess appointments in just an arrogant defiance of the senate 's prerogative of advice and consent. ''
the occasion was the state republican convention in fort worth .
he was first elected to office in 1956 as a rhode island state representative and served until 1963 , when he was elected governor for the first of three terms .
and representative bob weygand , a democrat from rhode island who is also running for the seat , said he hoped `` people would take time out to allow the family to grieve , and the state to grieve. ''
but because smith has switched from the republican party to become an independent , the chairmanship will likely go to senator james m . inhofe , republican of oklahoma , senate aides said .
washington _ sen . john ashcroft disputes an oklahoma colleague 's statement last week that the missouri republican was among 18 senators who favored blocking president clinton 's judicial nominations for the rest of his term .
`` clinton 's unquestionably the worst commander in chief in the history of america , '' inhofe , an army veteran who sits on the armed services committee , said in a recent telephone interview .
the brotherhood , founded by hassan el-banna in egypt in 1928 , grew into a vast movement with tens of thousands of supporters in egypt and branches throughout the arab world .
the muslim brotherhood is outlawed and many of its leaders are behind bars .
despite the religious covering for the event , mamoun el-hodeiby , the deputy lead of the movement , concedes it was meant to demonstrate the brotherhood 's popularity .
`` this is testimony that everyone recognizes that the brotherhood is not a marginal organization but a mass movement which enjoys the trust and confidence of all walks of life , '' he told the associated press on wednesday .
it was long unofficially tolerated , but since 1995 the government has clamped down on the group , accusing it of supporting a violent campaign by muslim militants to overthrow the secular government .
it also received support from leading opposition figures who said the brotherhood should be accepted as a legal political party .
`` the brotherhood is a national movement which has deep roots in our society , '' abdel adhim manaf , a leader of the pan- arab nasserite party , said in an interview tuesday .
`` all my life i believed that the brotherhood worked for the ...
the brotherhood in egypt has undergone a split in recent years .
el-hodeiby said the brotherhood itself is not giving up its demand for official recognition as a political party .
cairo , may 28 -lrb- xinhua -rrb- -- egyptian police detained 15 suspected members of the banned muslim fundamentalist group , the muslim brotherhood , in the past 10 days , security officials said on sunday .
more than 100 members of the muslim brotherhood have been arrested since october 1999 , dozens of whom since the beginning of this month , in a growing government crackdown on the movement .
the brotherhood , egypt 's largest muslim fundamentalist group , was banned in 1954 by the former president , gamal abdel nasser , but has enjoyed intermittent periods of official tolerance .
formed in 1928 , the muslim brotherhood was banned in 1954 , but was tolerated by the government until 1995 , when authorities arrested at least 200 brotherhood members .
the muslim brotherhood was founded in 1928 and banned in 1954 .
formed in 1928 , the muslim brotherhood was banned in 1954 , but the government of president hosni mubarak had tolerated it until 1995 .
formed in 1928 , the muslim brotherhood was banned in 1954 .
the muslim brotherhood , egypt 's biggest fundamentalist group established in 1928 , advocates turning egypt into a strict muslim state by political means , setting itself apart from militant groups that took up arms in 1992 .
it is banned in egypt though the group pledges it wants to achieve its goal of strict islamic rule only through peaceful means .

whitmore said he was most fascinated with the story of john chapman , who is better known as johnny appleseed .
there are apple trees that are believed to have been planted by john chapman , the arboreal enthusiast better known as johnny appleseed .
`` johnny appleseed '' was really an eccentric , homeless man called jonathan chapman , who walked barefoot in the coldest weather and devoted his life to planting apple seeds in the remote places of the american frontier .
appleseed , whose real name was john chapman , planted many trees in the early 1800s .

born john chapman in leominster , mass . , he left home after serving in the revolutionary war to start apple tree nurseries , and then sold the trees to settlers for about 6 cents a piece .
better known by the nom de pomme of johnny appleseed , he ranged far from his native leominster , planting apple trees wherever he roamed .
chapman was known to wear a cooking pot for a hat as he preached throughout indiana and ohio in the early 19th century and planted apple seeds for settlers who would follow .
it was among such treasures as atlas , apollo and space shuttle models ; his last job , before he retired in 1982 , was to prepare the first space shuttle , columbia , for launching in 1981 .
this is the third shuttle mission this year and the 83rd since columbia made the first shuttle flight in 1981 .
during their space voyage , the astronauts will set as many as 200 small fires in columbia 's laboratory .
liftoff was originally scheduled for 2 p.m . this afternoon , but a troubled leak check of the shuttle cabin made nasa delay the launch for another 20 minutes .
the shuttle landed right on time at the kennedy space center in cape canaveral , florida , where about 200 researchers waited with scalpels .
the trip added 6.4 million miles to the odometer of the oldest shuttle of the national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- .
after the shuttle landed , the crew was hustled off to medical tests that were expected to go on for days .
april 12 , 1981 : columbia soars on first space shuttle flight .
in 1981 , the space shuttle columbia blasted off from cape canaveral on its first test flight .
in 1981 , the first test flight of america 's first operational space shuttle , the columbia , ended successfully with a landing at edwards air force base in california .
the shuttles flying today have progressed since the columbia orbiter first took to space in 1981 .
this is the third shuttle mission this year and the 83rd since columbia made the first shuttle flight in 1981 .

washington _ the day after the space shuttle challenger disaster in 1986 , senator john glenn blasted nasa 's decision to send christa mcauliffe on the fatal mission .
jan . 28 , 1986 _ the shuttle challenger explodes moments after launch , killing its seven -member crew in the world 's worst space disaster .
the american and russian space programs have endured deaths and disasters before , including the grisly explosion of the challenger space shuttle over florida in january 1986 .
the end also seemed certain when , in january 1986 , the shuttle challenger exploded over florida .
replacing the shuttle 's dangerous solid-rocket boosters , which played a key role in the fatal 1986 challenger explosion , with reusable , winged liquid-fueled rockets that would drop off during launch and return to earth .
in another development , u.s . national aeronautics and space administration investigators who probed the challenger space shuttle disaster in 1986 were called in thursday to examine specific pieces of twa flight 800 's wreckage .
feb . 20 , 1986 _ the soviet union launches mir , its 10th and most successful space station .
`` there '' is in a position to seriously challenge arianespace , the european space agency , for leadership in commercial satellite launching .
hughes ' biggest domestic competitor is space systems/loral , while europe 's largest makers of commercial satellites include aerospatiale and matra marconi .
as the space shuttle proved itself , american launching companies focused almost exclusively on the military market .
but after the challenger explosion , the reagan administration severely cut back on the shuttle 's use for commercial purposes , arguing that it was not worth risking lives for tasks that could be performed by expendable rockets .
last year , for the first time , the commercial space business in the united states was larger than the market for military aircraft _ $ 30.6 billion versus $ 30.5 billion _ according to the trade group .
last fall , panamsat opened a policy worth more than $ 3 billion with an insurance group led by space machine advisors , based in greenwich , conn .
referring to a space machine advisors executive who was at the attempted launching last week , a panamsat spokesman said , `` he was the one with the real pale look on his face. ''
`` the space program is for basic , fundamental research , '' glenn said after mcauliffe , a concord , n.h . , high school teacher , and six crewmates died in the challenger tragedy .
what 's more , glenn said , space flight should not be `` a cosmic carnival ride. ''
on thursday , 12 years later , the 77-year-old democratic senator from ohio is poised to lift off for a shuttle ride in space .
and several critics are using his post- challenger remarks against him .
she was to have turned the shuttle into an orbiting classroom , conducting science experiments and lessons on space history that were to have been beamed by satellite to millions of american students .
mcauliffe was 37 when the challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff , killing the crew and effectively ending the civilian -in-space program .
although glenn expressed `` a profound , personal sense of loss '' over the challenger tragedy , he questioned the decision to send civilians into space while the shuttle program was still in `` its embryonic stage. ''
`` if the taxpayers come to believe that the space program is becoming a cosmic carnival ride , then we face the very real prospect that they may withdraw their support , '' glenn said .
after two years of aggressive lobbying to secure a seat on the discovery flight , glenn is scheduled to act as a human guinea pig for research on aging in the weightlessness of space .
glenn failed to convince rick tomlinson , president of the space frontier foundation , which promotes opening space travel to civilians .

dec . 3 , 1998 -lrb- scheduled -rrb- _ the second station module is launched aboard the u.s . space shuttle endeavour .
san francisco _ the international space station that is being assembled 285 miles above earth faces enough hazards to fill a stack of paperback science fiction thrillers .
fires , explosions , solar flares , power failures and collisions with space debris could threaten the station _ history 's grandest construction project and humanity 's first stepping stone to mars and worlds beyond .
daniel goldin , the administrator of the national aeronautics and space administration , expects to face `` countless problems and countless issues '' during station construction .
in space , `` you 're doing a bigger construction project in a horrible environment , '' said swain , who works at the university of kentucky .
the sheer size of the space station offers more opportunity for trouble .
they will study their physiological , psychological and orthopedic reactions to space flight , generating information useful for long-term missions to mars and beyond .
in deft maneuvers , the russian and u.s . shuttle crew connected the two components sunday and monday .
in february 1997 , the crew of the aging russian mir space station , including american jerry linenger , fought `` an impressive , life-threatening fire .

a former nasa engineer and space writer , he left the agency this year .
and if nasa officials think mir taught them about space station hazards , he said , `` this could be the road to more disasters. ''
disasters struck the first space stations .
in 1971 , the soviets launched salyut 1 ; its three -man crew asphyxiated on re-entry when their space capsule lost air pressure .
two years later , the united states launched a roomy , cylindrical space station called skylab .
nasa officials remain optimistic that they 've done everything they could to keep space station builders and inhabitants safe .
two decades after its birth , and 13 years after its worst tragedy , the space shuttle has become america 's year-round trucking service into space , an aging but respected draft horse in orbit .
but the venerable shuttle fleet is n't likely to be replaced for decades to come , nasa officials , engineers and former astronauts say because congress is unlikely to give the national aeronautics and space administration the money .
the b-52 analogy is valid , said bernard shaw , a former space shuttle commander who is now vice president and general manager of the international space station project for boeing co .
the space shuttle will be hard to replace , '' he said .
scheduled for completion about 2005 , the space station is being assembled primarily by shuttle launches that carry components to low earth orbit .
delayed retirement is a noble but ironic fate for the shuttle fleet , which almost died in its crib in the 1970s , when then-president richard nixon half-heartedly proposed it to a reluctant congress .
yet 13 years later , long after doomsayers had predicted a second shuttle disaster to occur , the fleet is still flying an average of seven to eight times a year .
allen is now director of space shuttle development for united space alliance , a shuttle -managing consortium created by the lockheed martin corp . and boeing that has managed shuttle flights under contract to nasa since 1996 .

shaw , the former shuttle commander , insists that nasa must make do with the shuttles for a long time to come .
on the other hand , he acknowledged , the nation must consider developing a complementary or backup space transportation system .
on jan . 28 , 1986 , the space shuttle challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff from cape canaveral , killing all seven crew members .
the space shuttle challenger was destroyed and its seven crew members killed when it exploded 70 seconds after launch in 1986 .
when the challenger exploded at 11 : 39 that morning , just 74 seconds after liftoff , killing all seven crew members , reagan decided to postpone his state of the union message .
jan . 28 , 1986 _ the shuttle challenger explodes moments after launch , killing its seven -member crew in the world 's worst space disaster .
challenger was lost on its 10th mission during a 1986 launch accident that killed seven crew members .
the shuttles underwent numerous , highly publicized safety modifications after the challenger explosion in 1986 took the lives of seven crew members .
clinton did not mention the january 1986 challenger explosion in which seven crew members were killed .
what immediately came to my mind was the whole challenger thing , '' he said .
lyn glenn said the close relationships that developed among discovery 's crew and family members during training helped her accept her father 's decision .
`` i ca n't say enough good about how nasa treats families and how nasa has taken great consideration of the other human beings involved in this besides the crew , '' she said .
`` over these months i 've gotten to know the crew and i 've learned more and more and more , and i think it 's very exciting .
members who have died include paul williams -lrb- 1973 -rrb- ; ruffin -lrb- 1991 -rrb- ; kendricks -lrb- 1992 -rrb- ; and franklin -lrb- 1995 -rrb- .
i seem to remember pictures of ronald reagan at the challenger launch when it blew up .
nancy and i are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle challenger .
the station 's three -member crew later die during their return to earth when their soyuz capsule decompresses .
sept . 29 , 1988 _ americans return to space aboard the shuttle discovery , after a 32-month absence in the wake of the challenger accident .
the shuttle likely will support the station 's cargo and crew rotation needs for much of the 10-year operations period that follows .
its multicolored displays could replace many of the 2,000 mechanical dials , gauges and switches that protrude from every surface of the shuttle crew cabin .
once a crew reaches space it can electronically store the displays needed for the launch phase and replace them with those needed just for the orbital phase .
more than 200 safety modifications followed the loss of challenger , most notably the redesign of the solid-fuel booster that triggered the disaster .
these changes , among thousands of major and minor design modifications that were made since the shuttles started flying , included redesigned solid-fuel booster rockets , more spacecraft sensors and a parachute escape system for the crew .
nasa plans to appoint a panel to look into what went wrong , and members of congress announced this week they will hold hearings on the matter in february .
some members of congress downplayed the financial impact of the loss .

mcauliffe was 37 when the challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff , killing the crew and effectively ending the civilian -in-space program .
as the seconds ticked away , there was mostly silence , a hush expectancy perhaps mindful of the terrible explosion that destroyed the shuttle challenger in 1986 about 90 seconds into flight when the booster separation went awry .
challenger explosion .
washington _ the day after the space shuttle challenger disaster in 1986 , senator john glenn blasted nasa 's decision to send christa mcauliffe on the fatal mission .
`` the space program is for basic , fundamental research , '' glenn said after mcauliffe , a concord , n.h . , high school teacher , and six crewmates died in the challenger tragedy .
what 's more , glenn said , space flight should not be `` a cosmic carnival ride. ''
and several critics are using his post- challenger remarks against him .
although glenn expressed `` a profound , personal sense of loss '' over the challenger tragedy , he questioned the decision to send civilians into space while the shuttle program was still in `` its embryonic stage. ''
after two years of aggressive lobbying to secure a seat on the discovery flight , glenn is scheduled to act as a human guinea pig for research on aging in the weightlessness of space .
nasa and some advocates for broader research on aging have defended glenn 's role on the discovery flight as a potentially valuable contribution to science .
tomlinson characterized glenn 's scheduled flight the way some of mcauliffe 's prelaunch critics described her mission .
